Hundreds of similar cases occur each year in Paraguay .
In this country , as throughout the whole of Latin America , Aids is more and more feminine , younger and poorer .
The syndrome affects more and more women who have acquired the virus in their own houses from their own husbands .
The numbers in Paraguay have caused an impact .
At the start of the epidemic there were twenty men infected for every woman .
Almost two decades later , in 2002 , the proportion registered is practically one man for every one woman .
The feminization of the illness is a phenomenon relatively new in the Southern Cone .
Initially HIV affected homosexuals and those dependent on drugs , who shared syringes .
But with the passing of the years the transmission began to be a problem common to young women and to the poorest segments .
Aids stopped being a question for men who had sex with other men and also became part of the daily situation of bisexuals and heterosexuals .
Many married men have sexual relationships with other men or women and then arrive home at night to sleep with their wives -- promiscuity during the day , fidelity during the night .
Thus , without knowing about the situation , many women have been sharing their bed not only with their partner , but also with his occasional lover , and all of the lovers of each of those lovers , and so on successively .
Paloma Cuchi , a doctor and the regional assessor of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , speaking by telephone from her office in Washington D.C. , recognizes this tendency .
She stated that susceptible populations -- homosexuals and those dependent on drugs -- have reached a point of such saturation that now they are pushing the illness to women and low-income populations .
More serious than this is the fact that social pressure upon women is slowing down her liberty to demand a preservative when maintaining sexual relations .
The macho culture that still permeates the region is added to a lack of education .
" Sexual inequality between men and women , when proposing the use of a condom , continues to exist .
Because it 's considered that she 's betraying her husband , or simply he refuses to use one .
There are also sexually working women to whom the request to not use a condom is continually made .
This imbalance between men and women continues and follows an economic imbalance .
When women have a higher level of education , they have greater economic possibilities and are also more capable of demanding equality in sexual relations , and not just in the use of a condom , but also within their sexual life as a whole , " she explains .
Nevertheless , families continue to educate women to turn them into housewives .
The young men go off to college and university .
The young women take care of their little brothers .
The young women prepare the food .
The young men know how to take care of themselves in sex and how to convince a non-educated woman to have unprotected sex .
This phenomenon can be confirmed by the numbers in Latin America .
In Chile , for example , within a few years the trend from one woman infected by HIV for every twenty men to one woman for every five men , at present .
In Brazil the situation is even more serious .
Data from 2002 has established that among adolescents between 13 and 19 years of age , the number of contaminated women already represents the double of contaminated men .
Both in the age group of 19 to 30 years and in the age group above this , the proportion is roughly one woman for every one man .
In Costa Rica , in only four years , the trend went from one woman for every twelve men to one woman for every seven men .
And in Paraguay , as previously stated , the proportion is now one to one .
Stolen life -- Right from that morning of November 1999 Ana 's life changed .
She had not understood what had happened .
" My life simply revolved exclusively around my family , my sons , for me the rest was nothing " From night to day she had been infected by a mortal illness of which she knew nothing .
And nobody gave her any information .
" That first year was terrible , " she recalls .
" At the beginning I couldn 't sleep at night , hunting the mosquitoes that I had to kill so that they would not bite my children , since they could have bitten me first .
I didn 't want to take my children to the dentist .
I didn 't even want to go to the bathroom so as not to contaminate them . "
I cried and ate the whole day .
In eight months I put on 40 kilograms .
Even though it has been scientifically proven that the Aids virus cannot be transmitted through the air , by insects or by saliva , the biased fears still continues in place , including among the health professionals themselves .
Ana suffered them on her very own skin .
" The doctors wouldn 't examine me , wouldn 't touch me . "
Until 1999 the patients who died of Aids in the Paraguayan public hospitals were pushed directly into a plastic bag and from there placed in sealed coffins , without giving the opportunity of family members to wash them or giving them a final kiss .
Even today discrimination imposes itself as an impediment of access to health care .
" We don 't treat people with Aids , " can be heard in the hospital corridors or the medical consulting rooms .
Poor treatment , contempt , looking down upon the patient still persists , and with a powerful force , in the health services .
For fear of losing the right to medications or for fear that they are known to be positive cases , many women suffer in silence .
They cry at their impotence on arriving home , but attempt to be strong in the face of a medical assistance service that does not even honor its name .
Dr. Cuchi confirmed that " the woman in general is discriminated against as far as access to the health services .
Some illnesses exist , such as uterus colon cancer , which are not included in the coverage for Aids cases .
In Paraguay , a positive diagnosis of Aids represents the difference between being attended to and being excluded from private medical services .
And the woman , given the manner in which she was educated , looks less and less towards medical attention .
They look for it when their children are ill or when they themselves are seriously ill , but this has cost them a lot , because they have no time , are always occupied , or because they must perform the role of pillars of their families .
One can still see a very large stigma in many sectors , including that of health .
But this is a theme that has a lot to do with development . "
When Ana became aware that she had been infected , she allowed an immense anger to invade her mind .
She blamed her husband , who had cheated on her , blamed herself for not having taken care .
Blamed her friends , because they continued healthy .
" At the beginning , through anger , through despair , I wanted to tell the world that I had been infected , " she recalls .
Red-headed , fat and happy , Ana arrived for the interview sweaty and carrying the bags of clothes that she sells to support three children .
She has no car , she goes by bus .
Since her husband died as a consequence of Aids , she has taken the reins of the house .
She works at anything : " Sometimes I work as a hairdresser , at other times I sell panties , sell cosmetics , if I had to wash someone else 's clothes , I 'd wash them , if I had to clean someone else 's house , I 'd clean it .
Work for me is not degrading , " she says , and then added " now . "
She guarantees that she was reborn two years ago .
Her life changed since she learned to live with Aids .
This began when she started to participate in self-esteem meetings promoted by the Win Foundation , founded by people who live with the virus .
As yet the symptoms of the infection cannot be noted in her .
She has no marks on her face , she has not lost weight , although her defenses had lowered more than a year ago and her viral level rose to the point where she had to start taking anti-retroviral medicines .
Nobody , bar a select group of family and friends from the Win Foundation , know that she carries the HIV virus in her body .
" My parents and my brothers ?
They say they support me , but nobody ever comes to my house , " she comments .
For this reason it is better to keep the secret .
State disinterest -- Another of the dramas that those infected with HIV in Paraguay must confront is the shortage of medicines .
The annual budget of US $ 500,000 destined to the Program of the Fight Against Aids does not allow for guaranteeing the annual medication needed by the four hundred and fifty ( 450 ) patients under treatment .
A further seven hundred ( 700 ) sick people exist who should be receiving medication , but they have not even begun because there treatment cannot be continued .
Things are different in Chile , where the State has an annual budget of US $ 15 million for the coverage of 90 % of the patients who require therapy .
In Brazil , one of the most advanced countries in the treatment of Aids , between 2000 and 2002 the government spent US $ 180 million on the coverage of the 140,000 people infected and in treatment .
Like the majority of those with the virus in Paraguay and in the rest of the Southern Cone , Ana is very poor .
Since her husband died , she has been merely existing .
For this reason , when she arrived at the program office and was told that this month there would be no medicine she felt unwell .
She knows that this is stealing days from her life .
Each interruption in the treatment has clinically irreversible consequences .
The virus gets stronger and each time more difficult to control .
" And what do you do when they don 't give you the medicine ? , "
" Nothing , " she replied with a nervous smile that she showed throughout the interview , " I look after myself with popular medicines , like ' olho-de-gato ' ( a variety of bonduc ) , which they say raises your defenses , I take anything . "
The Aids victims do not have any choice under these circumstances , because locally they cannot obtain the medicines and abroad their price is inaccessible to the vast majority .
Thanks to negotiations with pharmaceutical laboratories , the monthly cost of treatment has lowered from US $ 1,300 in 1996 to today 's price of US $ 180 .
Even at that , the Paraguayan government does not guarantee their supply .
Thankful for life -- Currently nobody speaks of " risk groups , " but of all of us , men and women , being exposed to acquiring the virus .
According to estimates made by the Fight Against Aids Program in Paraguay , around 12,000 people are infected .
It is known that seven of every ten infections occurs by sexual means and that the majority of cases are with heterosexuals .
Of the remainder , 13.2 % correspond to intravenous drug users and to some cases of errors in blood transfusions noted at the start of the epidemic .
The transmission from mother to newly born child contributes to some 3.5 % of the cases and around 11 % of the cases have an unknown method of infection transfer .
Now , after two years of conversation and education , Ana no longer fears that a mosquito will infect her sons with the HIV virus .
She no longer has any fear of harming them .
She only hopes to keep up with her medication and to remain as healthy as possible , and hopes that a treatment comes forward capable of curing her .
This is the same hope that some 42 million people have who currently live as carriers of the HIV virus and are suffering from Aids throughout the world .

Body with more gas
Compounds containing ruthenium , which liberate or capture nitric oxide , could serve as a basis for future medications
Carlos Fioravanti
" We could present ourselves as projectionists of made to measure chemical compounds that donate or capture nitric oxide . "
On imagining this possibility , Elia Tfouni does not intend to give up modesty , but is merely summarizing the results of ten years of work with Douglas Franco -- both are chemists and professors at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) .
In conjunction with researchers from the Federal University of Sao Carlos ( UFSCar ) , professors Tfouni , Franco and their respective teams , have developed close to fifty ( 50 ) compounds which in initial laboratory studies show themselves to be capable of absorbing or releasing nitric oxide , a colorless gas essential to the organism that appears and disappears all the time : its half life , when half of the total number of molecules break down , is only five seconds .
Produced , consumed and reproduced all the time , nitric oxide facilitates blood circulation , kidney function , the destruction of harmful microorganisms , penis erection and the contraction of the uterus at the time of giving birth , as well as serving as a chemical messenger between the neurons of the brain .
Few molecules are as versatile and omnipresent , although this chemical combination of one atom of nitrogen with one atom of oxygen had been viewed over decades mainly as a residue liberated at the exhaust pipe of motorcars -- until three American pharmacologists demonstrated its importance for human beings and won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1998 .
At times it may well be good to reduce the quantity of nitric oxide in circulation within the organism ; at other times , the best thing is to increase the supply of the molecule linked to life and death , to pleasure and pain .
In a septic shock , as is named the brutal drop in blood pressure that comes about from a bacteria infection , there is excessive production of nitric oxide -- associated as well with schizophrenia , Alzheimer 's disease , diabetes and asthma .
In these cases its abundance is not desirable and medicines that could reduce its concentration in the organism would be very welcome .
At other times , what is needed is the opposite effect , that is to keep the maximum possible quantity of nitric oxide in circulation , when taking into consideration its property of promoting the dilation of veins and arteries : medication such as Viagra are in fact based on this effect , by way of which the blood circulates more generously to the penis .
The reverse situation , the shortage of nitric oxide makes the blood vessels contract and turns the possibility of a heart attack more imminent .
Franco and Tfouni enjoy immensely adding that they have in their hands something new that avoids heart attacks and at the same time is a national Viagra .
But no so .
Their studies have been purely chemical and they are only just beginning tests on animals , the first stage of a long journey towards safe applications in human beings .
The compound that is in the most advanced stage of research is colloquially called RuNO , the abbreviation of an almost pronounceable name , trans-nitrosyltetraammin ( triethylphosphite ) ruthenium hexafluorophosphate .
In the laboratory , RuNo shows itself to be efficient at reducing the blood pressure of rats with hypertension , according to a study made in conjunction with Marta Krieger , from the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , and published in 2002 in the magazine Nitric Oxide : Biology and Chemistry .
Alessander Acácio Ferro , an ex-doctoral student of professor Tfouni , has developed other apparently promising compounds .
One is called hexafluorophosphate of ruthenium ( II ) trans-nitrosilchloro ( 1,4,8,11-tetra azacyclotetradecane ) -- or simply , cyclam -- and it exhibits an action twenty times slower when compared with sodium nitroprussiate , a compound used for treating heart attacks , which rapidly replaces the nitric oxide .
Even though the work has just begun , according to professor Franco , the result suggests that cyclam could be used to maintain the blood pressure stable , more than for resolving emergency situations as is done with nitroprussiate or nitroglycerine , which also liberates nitric oxide , as well as being a powerful explosive .
In a less advanced stage are the studies of Jean Jerley Nogueira da Silva , one of professor Franco 's students , on the potential use of these compounds in combating infections .
In collaboration with João Santana , from the Medical School of USP in Ribeirao Preto , Jean has verified that nitric oxide blocks the reproduction of the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi , which causes Chagas 's Disease , against which for decades now new medicines have not come forward .
Jean has selected three compounds with high destructive power : within an hour , each one of the three killed between 60 % to 92 % of the parasites grown on a culture .
Preliminary tests -- This research group reached their results by looking at the ionic properties -- electrically charged particles -- of the chemical element named ruthenium .
In its electrically neutral form , ruthenium is a white metal used in the production of non-corrosive alloys and in jewelry as a substitute for platinum .
With the loss of two electrons , it becomes Ru2 + and an experimental model for the development of new medications , as it combines easily with nitric oxide and forms compounds that are only slightly reactive .
" This is the simplest way of carrying out chemical synthesis that we have discovered , " says Franco , whose team is an integral part of the Chemistry Institute of Sao Carlos , whilst Tfouni and his students work out of the laboratories at USP 's Philosophy , Sciences and Arts School at Ribeirao Preto .
The ruthenium compounds are still treated with care , because of their toxicity .
Even at that , in controlled doses , they have been tested throughout the entire world against some illnesses , making up an alternative for today 's adopted strategies that control the stock of gas acting upon enzymes that produce nitric oxide or breaking them down after having complied with its task .
In a revision article published last year in the Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry , Celine Marmion and her team from the Royal College of Surgeons , in Dublin , Ireland , in conjunction with researchers from the Canadian company AnorMED , plotted out a rich future for the donors and captors of nitric oxide based on ruthenium compounds when describing the results of the new compounds tested on rats , pigs , cats and rabbits against wide ranging problems , such as hypertension , cancer , heart attack and inflammation .
The first clinical tests have also been done on human beings .
In a study also published last year in Clinical Cancer Research , researchers from the National Cancer Institute of Holland reported the discovery of the best dose of a ruthenium based compound that is apt to avoid the spreading of tumors , after having treated thirty four patients with different doses .
In parallel , specialists at the University of Trieste , In Italy , under the direction of Enzo Alessio , have found a formula given the name NAMI-A , which was tested on twenty- four people and which impedes the proliferation of cancerous cells .
" The ruthenium compound that we 've developed and tested is a lot less toxic than the anti-tumor compounds with platinum , but it 's clear that not all of ruthenium 's derivatives are of low toxicity , " comments Enzo Alessio , the study 's director , during 2004 in the magazine Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry .
In Bulgaria , a group has found a ruthenium derivative that combats leukemia in human cells .
Each research group adopts a basic chemical structure , from which they derive all of their compounds , much in the same manner as starting from a single chassis , models of simple or more luxurious cars are manufactured .
In the compounds formulated by the USP team , whose properties have been described in around forty ( 40 ) scientific articles published over the last ten years , ruthenium occupies the center of an imaginary eight-faced solid , in the form of two pyramidal units each with a square base .
It was inside this atomic platform that RuNO was formed , up until now the example of the most generous of donors of nitric oxide , which reacts 10,000 faster than another , for now the most parsimonious of the oxide delivered , cyclamNO ( this is the same cyclam as that immense name , but now without the nitric oxide or NO ) .
" We could create intermediate compounds that retard or accelerate the liberation of nitric oxide by varying the chemical ligands , " says Tfouni .
Ligands are the molecules that form the external skeleton of this eight-faced solid .
The four vertices of the common base of the two pyramids are formed by relatively complex molecules , made up of groups of between ten to forty atoms , such as multi-pyridines , tetraamines , aminopolycarboxylates or salen , in accordance with the chemical class to which they pertain .
On the top one of the pyramids there are simpler ligands -- sulfite , phosphite , chloride or simply water -- that are decisive in the liberation of nitric oxide , situated in another extreme of this complex structure .
Runaway electron -- In collaboration with researchers from the University of Arizona , the University of California and the National Health Institutes ( NIH ) , of the United States , the USP chemists constructed their substances in the laboratory in such a way that the nitric oxide will be released it receives a light beam of sufficient energy or when it meets a solitary electron , the elementary particle of negative charge that orbits the atomic nucleus .
Next , according to professor Tfouni , the position that the nitric oxide had occupied becomes vacant and is taken over by another molecule -- generally water .
This same structure , now with a water molecule occupying the nitric oxide 's position , but with one less electron , performs the reverse function and turns itself into a nitric oxide captor .
This is a perfect union between an atomic structure with one electron less and a gas made up with an electron that easily escapes .
By losing an electron the nitric oxide becomes more reactive -- is hungry for an electron , shall we say -- and rapidly adheres to other molecules of the organism , an example being the iron of hemoglobin , the protein that distributes oxygen to the body 's cells .
In order to arrive at these results , this USP team of chemists on average work a week in preparing the reactions between the initial reactant compounds , which are colored red , blue , green or yellow , but which lose their color when they combine with the oxygen and the nitrogen of nitric oxide .
Another week of tests and analysis are run through until finally they arrive at the certainty that the reaction products are exactly those expected .
But what are the real chances of these compounds moving ahead , passing through all of the stages and turning themselves effectively into medications ?
Sixty-year-old Franco , and sixty-one-year-old Tfouni know that they are dealing with a long journey , in view of the difficulty of passing on academic research results to the Brazilian sector of the chemical-pharmaceutical industry , which is not conspicuous by its familiarity with scientific research , which could help them to depend less on importations .
In 2004 , according to a survey produced at the start of March , the imbalance in the commercial balance of the pharmaceutical industry was accentuated , with exports at US $ 351 million ( 25 % more than the previous year ) and imports running at U $ 1.8 billion ( 17 % more ) .
The Brazilian Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry ( Febrafarma ) itself , responsible for this survey , recognizes that this difference is only going to close when they themselves widen their investments in research and development .
Even at that , the work continues .
At the end of last year , Patrícia Zanichelli , from professor Franco 's team , obtained the first samples of macromolecules named dendrimers , containing twenty seven repeating ruthenium , ligands and nitric oxides , and also of silica -- or pure sand -- embedded in the donors and in the captors of nitric oxide , whose distribution in the organism would then be more controlled and directed only to some organs of the human body .
With these special pure sands , developed by Fabio Gorzoni Doro and Kleber Queiroz Ferreira , two of professor Tfouni 's doctorate students , it is intended to cover the surface of stainless steel and thus increase the efficiency of the devices known as stents , a type of spring that maintains the arteries open and helps to avoid a heart attack -- each of which costs around US $ 2,000.00 .
Stents already exist that have been covered with antibiotics , liberated during one or two weeks , but not donors of nitric oxide of long duration , as the USP chemists would like .
" We 'd like these compounds to last as long as the very steel of the stent itself , " said professor Tfouni .
" It 's very difficult , but getting close is already very good . "
He knows that a good stainless steel lasts at least twenty years .

The weather guardians
Caves reveal how the climate of the southern hemisphere has been for the last 100,000 years
Carlos Fioravanti
Ivo Karmann entered onto the geology course at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) , in 1977 , to study in depth the caverns that he loved to explore since his days as a young boy .
But at that time the caverns were still seen as an alternative for adventure tourism -- and in Brazil there was little interest from the geological point of view .
Karmann insisted , conquered the attention of a few scarce professors who showed themselves disposed to supervising his research , and has now also become an USP professor , has formed a team , and almost thirty years later , has proven that caverns house formidable raw material for geology , capable of registering climate and vegetation changes over thousands of years .
After associating a series of data collected inside and outside of a cavern in Santa Catarina state and another in Sao Paulo State , Karmann and his group of students , almost all of them speleologists , as they are called , have concluded that over the last 116,000 years there has been intense variation in the amount of rainfall in the south and southeast regions of Brazil : the heavy rains of the past or , the reverse situation of a shortage of rainfall , were principally due to a greater or lesser intensity of solar radiation -- insolation -- , which varies in accordance with the inclination of the Earth 's rotational axis , in cycles of around 23,000 years .
Depending on the inclination of the Earth 's axis there can be more shadow in the northern hemisphere and greater solar cover in the southern hemisphere -- or vice versa .
These discoveries about climate behavior in the past are helping to refine the models of climate simulation , which are going to provide more reliable forecasts while they have reflected the past with greater precision .
" Insolation during summer has been increasing over the last 4,000 years in the southern region , making the summers on the Santa Catarina coastline become gradually more rainy , " explains Francisco William da Cruz Jr . , ex-master 's and doctorate degree student of Karmann and the first named author of a study published in March in Nature with these findings .
" This is a natural tendency that should be maintained over the next few thousand years , without considering any human intervention on climate . "
A greater insolation , as this USP group has verified , intensifies the circulation of humid winds that arrive from the Atlantic to the east coast and feed the Amazon Rainforest .
Known as the Trade Winds , these winds circulate in the lower atmosphere , close to the surface , move off to the south and enter into the Amazon and bring humidity to the south and southeast regions of Brazil .
They also reach the north of Argentina and Paraguay , favoring the formation of clouds and rainfall .
In times of lesser insolation , the Trade Winds calm down and the humidity that brings about the rains in the south and southeast regions provides rain mainly in the Southern Atlantic .
Forest and shrublands -- The displacement of humidity in the proximity of the equator results in more rainfall in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil .
" In the northeast the climate and environmental changes were radical , " says Augusto Auler , a geologist at the Geosciences Institute of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , and the co-author of an article about the ancient climate of the northeast , published in December in the magazine Nature , the first named author of another , also produced at the end of last year in the Journal of Quaternary Science .
These works have shown that the so called Zone of Convergence Inter Tropical ( ZCIT ) , a region of the atmosphere filled with humidity , which moves in a north to south direction above the ocean , close to the equator , had previously been more to the south -- closer to the Brazilian northeast -- and brought rains that fed the tropical forest .
Afterwards , when the ZCIT moved off to the north , without approximating itself so much to the continent , it had been directed to reign over a countryside similar to that of today .
Studies by other groups had already raised the remains of ancient humid forests in the northeast of Brazil , but what was lacking was to show exactly in which eras of the past the present shrublands had been tropical forest .
The last time that there had been in this location high , green and lush forest , so vast that it probably linked the Amazon to the Atlantic Rainforest , was around 15,000 years ago .
But before in the interior of the northeast a dry and sparsely vegetated region , similar to that of today , had reigned .
The forest , fed by humid winds , flourished for brief periods of a few thousands years -- around about 39,000 , 48,000 and 60,000 years ago , to cite only the closest intervals of time -- which correspond to the phases of most intense and constant rains .
The longest period in which a semi-deciduous forest -- one that loses its leaves for a few months of the year -- populated the today dry lands of the northeast , lasted almost 5,000 years , from 68,000 to 63,000 years ago , according to the studies carried out by geologist Auler in conjunction with researchers from the universities of Minnesota , in the United States , Bristol , in England , and of Taiwan , in China .
In Brazil , he was able to count upon the collaboration of the biologist Patrícia Cristalli , from the University of Mogi das Cruzes and USP .
This team searched through the interior and the surroundings of two caverns in the interior of the State of Bahia , named Toca da Barriguda and Toca da Boa Vista , the largest in the southern hemisphere with some 108 kilometers in extension .
Geologist Auler and his team collected and analyzed stalagmites from the caverns the same as the USP group , but went beyond that and also studied the fossils of leaves found in the deposits of calcite -- the mineral composed of calcium carbonate-- accumulated under an open sky .
Thus it was possible to reconstruct , as well as the vegetation formation of up to 210,000 years ago , the animals that also lived there .
There were no lack of examples of large size animals , such as sloths and giant armadillos .
There was also a monkey , the Caipora bambuiorum , of close to 40 kilograms , and double the size of the current largest Brazilian monkey , the woolly spider monkey .
The UFMG team that described in an article published in 1996 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science knew that they were dealing with a tree dwelling animal , but they had no idea as to when it could have lived .
Now it can be confirmed that the Caipora bambuiorum probably lived some 15,000 years ago , in the middle of the forest that would later give way to the dry corridor of almost 3,000 kilometers in extension , which separates the Amazon Forest from the Atlantic Rainforest .
Together the two research groups conferred a continental dimension to the study of paleoclimate in Brazil , showing that the intense rains that fell -- and still fall -- in the south and southeast regions could have originated in the humid Amazonian basin , transported for thousands of kilometers .
They have also suggested that the reduction of humidity in the Amazon Rainforest , currently caused by deforestation , can alter the ritual of rains in the southern region .
That was what happened last year , remembered Pedro Leite da Silva Dias , from the Astronomy , Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences Institute ( IAG ) of USP , who participated in the work conducted by professors Karmann and Cruz , with researchers from the University of Massachusetts and from the Berkeley Geochronology Center , both in the United States , and from the Geology Institute of Sao Paulo .
During last summer the humid winds from the Amazon basin did not move down as much south of the equator .
They only reached the States of Minas Gerais and Bahia , causing intense rains .
The Rio Grande do Sul State , without the humidity that it normally comes from the Amazon basin , suffered a drought .
Also the team provided evidence on the versatility of one of the methods used for checking their conclusions : The analysis of the proportion of the isotopes of oxygen , 18O and 16O , which correspond to the heaviest and lightest forms of oxygen atoms , in the minerals that make up the stalagmites -- the calcite columns that grow up from the ground in the direction of the ceiling of the caverns .
The reason is that the proportion between the two forms of oxygen in the stalagmites depends principally on the composition of the rainwater and can reflect the atmospheric changes of up to 500,000 years ago , as the USP researchers attested to in a recently accepted article for publication in the magazine Chemical Geology .
The biologist Marie-Pierre Ledru , a specialist in pollens from the University of Montpellier II , in France , used the information obtained by the USP team from the Santana cavern to complete those that she herself had managed by analyzing pollens , whose method of dating can reach back to the maximum of 40,000 years .
Her objective was to date and to recompose the ancient vegetation of the Colonia , a circular depression of almost four kilometers in diameter to the south of the city of Sao Paulo , possibly the result of a meteorite impact or a comet fragment .
The results of Marie-Pierre 's study , in conjunction with the USP team , published this month in the magazine Quaternary Research , indicated that the periods of expansion of the forests in this area that reminds one of the crater of a volcano , coincide approximately with the variations in the atmospheric circulation of the last 110,000 years .
When the theory is insufficient -- But there were many stones along the pathway of these discoveries that have managed to relate the proportionality of the isotopic oxygen atoms in the stalagmites over the thousands of years with changes in the global atmospheric circulation .
In 1999 , Karmann and Cruz , along with Oduvaldo Viana Jr . , one of Karmann 's students for mater degree , began a monthly visit to the Santana caverns , located in the Ribeira Valley , in the southeast of the state of Sao Paulo , and those of Botuverá , in the east of Santa Catarina state .
They didn 't go there just to appreciate the caverns , but as researchers , equipped to collect the water that dropped from the ceiling and which with time would form the stalagmites .
They also brought back samples of the stalagmites themselves for analysis in the laboratory .
After two years of work the team was joined by the geographer José Ferrari , from the Geology Institute of Sao Paulo , having already discovered the age of two stalagmites .
One of them , 1.6 meters in length that had been retrieved from a point some 300 meters below the ground and some 1,500 meters from the mouth of the Santana cavern , through which a subterranean river runs .
The other , some 70 centimeters in length , was collected at a depth of 110 meters and some 300 meters from the mouth of the Botuvera cavern .
Cruz and Warren Sharp , from the Berkley Geochronology Center ( BGC ) , in the United States , carried out the dating of the stalagmites and concluded that both were between 111,000 and 116,000 years old .
This was an excellent beginning , since they were probably dealing with the oldest records obtained at the end of the last ice age in South America when the masses of ice from the north and south poles expanded and the coast line shrunk , as if the sea had lowered considerably -- around 100 meters on average .
Once the dating of the stalagmites was been carried out , the USP group began preparing a graph about the variation , over time , of the ratio between the two oxygen isotopes accumulated along the axis of growth of the stalagmites .
In the tropical regions of the planet , the variation between them is accustomed to indicating the eras in which it rained more or rained less , because the heavier isotope 18O , is lost with the first rains , leaving the water with more and more of the 16O isotope .
The proportionality curve between the two forms of oxygen had accompanies the periods of insolation , but the only theory at hand -- according to which the ratio between 18O and 16O should respond directly to the volume of rain -- had not been able to explain the results .
" We remained in the dark , " says Karmann , reminding himself of the times in which he was in the caves and suddenly the carbide charge that generated the light to illuminate the way forward had ended .
They thought that there could have been more than one origin of the rainwater -- the problem was that there was no way of proving it .
But they were certain .
" The major merit of this work is exactly in showing that the humidity of the south and southeast could have origins completely different , " comments Pedro Dias , a professor at USP 's IAG to whom the geologists turned for help after they had suffered a year in silence .
And the solution was relatively simple .
According to Dias and his IAG team , the intensity of the rains in the past -- and those of today as well -- in the south and southeast regions result from humidity that arrives from the Amazon basin or from the Atlantic Ocean .
Stirred up by the insolation , the Trade Winds coming from the Amazon basin help to compact the atmospheric region known as the South Atlantic Convergence Zone ( SACZ ) with even more humidity .
Fed as well by the humidity that it receives from the ocean south of the equator , the SACZ is a vast gathering of clouds , at times with up to 5,000 kilometers in extension , directed in a northeast to southwest direction , which crosses the Brazilian coastline between the latitudes of 18o to 25o south .
When the insolation is greater , there is more heat and humidity in the tropics .
The SACZ intensifies and displaces itself more in a southerly direction , resulting in more rain in this region .
This is when the lighter isotope of oxygen , the 16O , predominates -- the heavier isotope stays behind , washed out by the rain that falls along the way .
In the reverse situation , when the insolation is lower in the southern hemisphere ( and greater in the northern hemisphere ) , there is a lowering of the level of heat and of the Trade Winds -- and hardly any humidity arrives from the Amazon basin .
" When it rains less in summer , " comments Andréa Cardoso , from the IAG team , " the SACZ weakens or remains more to the north . "
The humidity that reaches the south and southeast regions then comes from a much closer source , the Southern Atlantic .
Brought by the winds that blow from the ocean to the continent and by the masses of polar air , this humidity results in a drier climate that can be currently be observed in the winters of the southern region .
This is when the heavier isotope of oxygen , the 18O , which had no time to fall as precipitation , predominates since the distance to the continent is relatively short .
Islands of green -- This coming and going of the atmosphere 's humid air to the south of the equator also explains how the humid forests in the territory today occupied by the Caatinga ( semi-arid desert ) , according to studies coordinated by Auler .
In the semi-arid northeast the intensification of humidity brought about an expansion of the jungles that covered the higher grounds and of the forests of the Cerrado ( wooded savanna ) , an environment accustomed to intense climatic variations .
When the humidity moved away , the soil dried up and the forest retreated .
Currently there still are islands of green and dense vegetation -- the so-called stands -- in the middle of the torrid Caatinga .
They grow at the foot of sierras , such as the plateaus of Borborema , Araripe and Ibiapaba , at altitudes that vary between 500 and 1,000 meters , favored by the current climate .
" This work opened my eyes to the value of information removed from caverns , " recognizes Pedro Dias , a mathematics graduate who made his way towards the study of climate some three decades ago -- I had only been in caves a few times , and , he stated , I hadn 't enjoyed it much .
" I believe that this one will reach back to 150,000 years , " he comments while preparing to saw it up , that is , to open up and saw off yet another slice of the rock column extracted from the Santana cavern , which as yet has not been studied as much as that of Santa Catarina .

Trick of the eye
Simple equations explain the localization of objects that seem to come from nowhere
Francisco Bicudo
The preferred victims of cursing by soccer fans , mainly when they flag up for offside , when the attacker is face to face with the goalkeeper , linesmen and lineswomen would be thankful if a visual illusion called flash-lag were better known .
This phenomenon , which can be looked upon as that which is seen late , manifests itself in situations in which an object in motion is caught by surprise in its trajectory by a second element , which occurs very close to it and abruptly .
The scene that comes about gives the impression of the existence of distance , even though it 's small , between the two .
What appears by surprise , seems to be behind the first , but in reality the two are in parallel , side by side .
This could an argument to be usesdby the linesmen in order to justify some of their mistakes .
On the field , fighting to keep up with the play , in general very fast , the referee 's assistant identifies the presence of the adversary 's last defender only after looking firmly for the position of the attacker and of worrying about the moment of the final forward pass .
He remains with the impression that the attacker had been advancing , in front of the defender , and raises his flag , thus marking the offside .
But the attacker should have been allowed to play on because the two players had been on the same line -- there was no irregularity in the play .
" The linesman can easily be deceived by this virtual illusion , " assures the neurophysiologist Marcus Vinícius Chrysóstomo Baldo , a graduate in physics and medicine , and a researcher at the Biomedical Sciences Institute ( ICB ) of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) .
Baldo and Nestor Felipe Caticha Alfonso , from the Physics Institute of USP , based on what had already been known about the working of neurons , created a mathematical model that helps to explain this lateness in perception of objects .
The two physicists applied the situations in which the flash-lag appears within classical mathematical approach , already used to study memory and learning , known as artificial neural networks .
According this approach , the regions of the nervous system responsible for vision are divided into layers formed by lines of neurons that communicate simultaneously with other neurons of the following layer , but not just in a direct manner : each nerve cells can interact with the others also in a divergent and convergent manner , indeed , making use of diagonal routes .
This is the reason for which the information takes more time to flow through this network and , as a consequence , there is a delay in the formation of an image of the object that appears ' all of a sudden ' -- hence the flash-lag .
" Up until now the majority of the explanations were conceptual ; mathematical models with this biological realism do not exist , " explains Caticha .
" We now have an instrument that is more precise and accurate , and that can be tested experimentally . "
The model that they created incorporates physical and physiological explanations , placing in numerical language the connections between the neurons , the electrical stimuli that allow this communication and the very structure of the neural circuits .
There are no enigmatic formulae , but essentially only addition and multiplication : the detail is that there are dozens or even hundreds of equations solved at the same time by a computer program .
Each equation expresses two mathematical variables : the electrical activity of each neuron and the sum of the influences each one of them receives from the others with which it is related .
The consolidated knowledge about the working of vision was the starting point .
We see because the light , on penetrating the eyes , stimulates photosensitive cells , located on the retina , which cover the inside wall of the eyeball and is composed of a complex grouping of neuronal layers .
It is on the retina that light and dark transform themselves into nerve pulses , now followed by a second group of neural circuits , the thalamus , a type of nervous system filter that directs the information to a third processing stage , the cerebral cortex .
And it is here that the fascinating process of the construction of perceptual vision takes place , which allows us to recognize a player in movement close to the goal , a silent and colored snake in the forest or a familiar face in the middle of a crowd .
The physicists ' model incorporates exactly this architecture in layers that characterizes the nervous system , though , in its current stage , there is not the commitment that they identify the model 's layers as being the complex layers of cortical cells or even of the neuronal layers already present in the retina .
As in a theatre -- Baldo compares each layer to the seating plan inside a theatre where the places are numbered in accordance with the rows , represented by letters , and the columns identified by numbers .
In this manner , a neuron located in the first layer , location A5 , interacts with his partners who occupy , for example , the seats B4 , B5 and B6 in the second row , which can , on their part , dialogue with their neighbors C3 to C7 , in the third row .
Furthermore , the electrical impulses exchanged between them -- by way of synapses , also simulated by the computer -- could be of activation , when the neuron receives an order to do something , or of inhibition , which corresponds to an order not to do anything -- as if they were positive or negative signals .
For example , if a neuron were to receive signals coming from five other neurons , three of these signals could be of activation and two of inhibition .
If the result of the signals were to be greater than a previously established program value , the receptor neuron would set off a new impulse , which would be transmitted to the following layer .
If the sum were to be below this value , known as a limit , a real physiological property , the neuron would remain inactive , without passing on the information .
It is this communication based on convergence and divergence , summed to the time taken for its completion , which explains the phenomenon known as flash-lag .
Baldo and Caticha believe that the model applied to flash-lag could help in explaining other visual illusions , such as the Fröhlich Effect , when an object in movement seems to be behind another , static , and hinders the formation of details of the start of the trajectory .
Imagine a wildcat jumping out from behind a tree : probably it will not be possible to identify its mouth and snout , which are the first to turn up from behind the tree , and the image of the wildcat would be built up starting from either the left or the right sides of its face .
A better understanding about the different visual illusions also represents the possibility of knowing in greater detail the general working of vision itself .
Baldo does not discard the hypothesis of any image formed , even those called normal , which in theory do not suffer interferences , could be considered an illusion , since they will never be an exact representation of reality .
" I believe that all of us look at the same person or at the same scenario with differences in details , not always subtle , " he suggested .
" Vision is always an interpretive reading of the world and there is no absolute precision . "
Late images -- Flash-lag began to catch people 's attention in 1958 , with an article from the physicist Donald MacKay , from the University of Keele , England , published in Nature .
In this work , physicist MacKay described a phenomenon that would remain for many years without an explanation : when he had agitated a lamp and had illuminated it with another source of stroboscopic light -- which goes on and off at regular intervals , in successive flashes -- , one had the impression of seeing the filament to the front , as if it were outside of the lamp .
Only in 1994 did the Indian psychologist Romi Nijhawan , currently at the University of Sussex , also in England , offered the first explanation about the phenomenon , when stating that all of the objects are seen with a delay .
Thus , a car that is coming down a road could already be a meter in front when the brain manages to process the image .
According to Nijhawan , the evolution of the human brain must have developed a mechanism to automatically eliminate the difference in phase of space and the delay in the perception of the image , but only when the trajectory is already known .
If there is a surprise the brain will not be capable of making these adjustments-- and flash-lag will pop up .
For this reason the risk of being knocked down by a car that seems to have come ' all of a sudden ' around the corner is greater .
In 1995 , Baldo and the American physicist Stanley Klein , from the University of California , United States , also published in Nature another study concerning flash-lag , showing that this type of visual illusion could well come from lack of attention .
The idea was simple : as one 's attention is drawn to the object in movement , it takes a longer time to perceive and determine the position of any new element that appears on the scenario like a flash and calls one 's attention to it .
Neurons in neutral -- Very similar arguments were used three years later , in 1998 , by two independent groups of researchers : one headed by the American professor of optometry , Harold Bedell , today at the University of Houston , United States ; the other one coordinated by two psychologists , David Whitney , currently at the University of Western Ontario , in Canada , and Ikuya Murakami , from the NTT Communication Science Laboratories , in Japan .
The two teams had been working with the perspective of time differences in the perception of objects -- or latencies .
They held that the brain , already accustomed with the previously identified scene , had the need to go through a type of warming up process in order to return to its neural activity and to register a new object .
It is as if the neurons were already in a position of resting , in neutral , and thanks to the sudden stimulus they saw themselves obliged to pass again through first , second and third gears until they recover their normal velocity .
The model from the two physicists unifies these theories , showing that the proposals previously showing discrepancies or even contradictions are , in truth , facets of the same phenomenon looked at from different angles .
Now , a warning .
Before they presented the mathematical model that they created and that will shortly be published in the magazine Vision Research , Baldo and Caticha usually invite for a test people who visit them for the first time .
They ask that the visitor sit in front of a switched on computer and they would off the light in the room , full of archives and papers spread over the desk .
With just a click on the mouse a small line appears on the screen , always moving horizontally , in a straight line .
When it reaches a fixed point , predetermined and marked , a luminous flash --a second line -- blinks on the screen .
The task is to say where this second point had appeared .
Most of the times the reply from this reporter was : " Before the other one . "
The researchers smiled with satisfaction , faced with yet another victim of the effect of flash-lag : in truth , the two lines had been in line .
The explanation that the two physicists then offer clarifies why many times we are betrayed by vision , and allows us to look with more sympathy at the difficulties confronted by linesmen on a football field , under the eyes of thousands of fans .

Leaves from the Amazonian tree guarantees the continued production of the perfume Chanel No 5
Dinorah Ereno
The legendary phrase spoke by the actress Marilyn Monroe in which she said she goes to sleep wearing only a few drops of Chanel No.5 hides behind , who would believe it , a very Brazilian touch .
The main ingredient of the famous French perfume launched by the company of Mademoiselle Coco Chanel in 1921 is the essential oil extracted from the wood of the rosewood , a tree native to the Amazon .
Estimates indicate that around 500,000 trees of this species have been chopped down since the start of the exploration of the rosewood , which led the Brazilian Environmental and Natural Renewable Resources Institute ( IBAMA ) including it on their list of endangered species in April of 1992 .
In order to preserve the precious wood and to guarantee the provision of the raw material for the perfume industry , professor Lauro Barata , from the Natural Chemical Products Laboratory of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , began , in 1998 , to develop a project for the extraction of the essential oil from the leaves , which resulted in yield and quality similar to that obtained from the wood .
" I learned that the oil could be removed from the leaves in work published by professor Otto Gottlieb , " says Barata .
He was referring to a study published at the end of the 1960s by the chemist who was born in the Czech Republic and who was a naturalized Brazilian , a retired professor at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) and remembered still by the Brazilian scientific community as having competed for the Nobel Prize .
" I also learned from the experience of Raul Alencar , a riverside woodsman aged eighty who always lived off the products of the forest and is a traditional producer of rosewood oil , " adds Barata .
These two references served as the basis for his project , funded by the Banco da Amazônia ( Basa ) , to the value of R $ 25,000.00 .
The Unicamp professor 's interest in studying the Amazonian tree came about in 1997 , when French ecologists started a campaign to boycott Chanel products because of the extraction of the rosewood , which has the scientific name of Aniba rosaeodora , and the consequent devastation of the forest .
In reply , the French company hired the NGO named Pro-Natura , of French-Brazilian origin , which works in partnership with companies to develop programs of sustainable development .
The objective was to find a solution that would calm down the environmentalists .
Barata was then called in by the NGO to make a diagnosis of the situation on the oil extraction from the Amazonian tree .
In his final report , he had set out how to work with sustainable production of the rosewood , which had begun with the rearing and managing of the tree and then passed to oil extraction from its leaves .
" We carried out a survey producing an inventory of the situation and the company promised to adopt the sustainable development proposal in our report , " says Barata .
" The appointed solution managed to stop the planned manifestations . "
But until today they continue buying the extract obtained from the trees cut down in their entirety in the middle of the forest .
International pressure brought about a return of the possibility of sustainable management of the rosewood and , after a series of discussions , with the participation of the producers , in 1998 IBAMA launched an edict with directives that regulated the extraction of the tree .
Experimental extraction - Starting from the study recommended by Chanel and with the project financed by Basa , Barata made various trips to the Amazonian region , which resulted in the work of growing rosewood trees in partnership with the producer Raul Alencar .
An area of scrub growth - the vegetation that arises after the deforestation of the original forest - in the municipality of Nova Aripuanã , in the state of Amazonas , was chosen to house the seedlings of the plant .
Today the area has 10,000 three and a half year old trees that are now ready to be pruned to start the experimental extraction of the oil .
For commercial exploration , the pruning could be started after five years for the extraction of linalool and after twenty-five years the tree could be cut down and the oil extracted from its wood , in this case in a sustainable manner .
The pure oil has a golden yellow coloration .
At the start it has a strong aroma , slightly citric , which dominates over the other aromas .
With the passing of time , other smells group themselves to the first , making up a harmonic mixture , sweet and mature .
The oil obtained from the leaves is a little yellow , with a smell that is clearly suave , without many gradations .
In order to test the quality of the oil , leaves of different ages , between five and thirty-five years , were collected both in the forest and in the cultivated fields during a six month period .
The first experimental plantation evaluated was established in 1990 by researchers from the Federal Rural University of Amazonia ( Ufra ) , in the municipality of Benfica , some twenty seven kilometers from the city of Belém , in the state of Pará , in collaboration with the researchers Selma Ohashi and Leonilde Rosa .
Another plantation used for study is in Curuá Una , in Pará , where three hundred trees that were planted in 1973 exist .
The oil extracted from the leaves showed a yield and quality similar to that from the wood .
On the item of quantity of oil obtained from the leaves , the variation was from 0.9 % to 1.1 % , on average , or that is , around ten kilograms of oil per ton of leaves , a yield similar to that extracted from the wood .
In relation to aroma , the oil from the leaves lost a little in its maturity .
This can be corrected in the laboratory .
" All that is needed is a physical-chemical treatment for one not to notice any difference between them , " Barata explains .
Without revealing the actual steps of this treatment done in the laboratory , and which can be reproduced industrially , he sent samples of the oils from the leaves and the trees to be evaluated by two representatives in Brazil of international perfume houses .
Their evaluation was that the differences between the two samples were minimal , and one of them assured that the fragrance of the oil from the leaves was better than that of the wood .
Today the extraction is done using only trees that are found in the forest , not in cultivated fields , which are few and experimental .
For the forest tree to reach the time for cutting down takes on average thirty to thirty-five years .
And to obtain a ton of linalool it is necessary to cut down between twenty-five and fifty trees .
If the managing and the cultivation were to be done properly , with the choosing of the best matrixes , this time could fall to twenty-five years .
Currently the annual production of rosewood oil runs at around forty tons , which represents a small fraction of the four hundred and fifty tons produced during the 1950s .
The decline in demand is due principally to the introduction of synthetic linalool onto the market in the 1980s .
But even if this had not occurred , the producers , today reduced to only six , would not have been able to keep up with the demand because the tree , which previously had been found throughout the Amazon , is now concentrated in the municipalities of Parintins , Maués , Presidente Figueiredo and Nova Aripuanã , all in the state of Amazonas , within a circle of 500 kilometers .
The species is already extinct in French Guiana , from where it began to be extracted at the start of the 1920s , and shortly afterwards in the States of Amapá and Pará .
Synthetic linalool does not substitute natural linalool since the fragrance is of an inferior quality .
However , it serves as a base for soaps and other hygiene and beauty products .
The facility to produce the essential oil was so huge that when the soap called Phebo was launched in 1930 , in Brazil , is had in its formula rosewood oil , something unthinkable today because of the high price of the raw material .
" Linalool is also found in other vegetable sources such as basil , but no other source shows a quality better than that of the rosewood .
Whilst in the rosewood the linalool represent 80 % of the composition of the essential oil , in basil this percentage remains at 30 % , " explains Barata .
In order to extract the essential oil it is necessary to walk a lot in the forest because the trees are well scattered in nature .
For every six hectares , one finds only a single tree .
In order to locate them , each woodsman penetrates into the woods on his own .
When a rosewood is spotted , the tree is marked with a large knife with the initials of the producer .
Those that should not be cut down are also identified , one of IBAMA 's demands , in order to preserve the matrixes that are producing seeds .
Measuring up for cutting - In summer , another team again penetrate into the forest to cut down the marked trees .
" Only trees that measure more than four hand lengths in circumference are cut down , " says Barata .
The measure of the hand is done by extending the hands open , but with the thumbs touching .
The four-hand measure corresponds to around 30 centimeters in diameter .
After the tree has been felled , the trunk and branches are cut up with a saw and carried on the back , tied to a bag made of vines , to the river 's edge .
There they remain until there are enough of them to be transported by boat to the mill for the extraction of the oil , which only happens in the winter , when the narrow waterways are navigable .
The extraction is done by a method of steam boiling , using equipment similar to that of a huge pressure cooker of 1,500 liters capacity .
In this process the steam passes through the aromatic plant , extracting , condensing and separating out its essences .
All of the process , which has its beginning with the tree marking and ends with the wood inside the mill , takes on average a year .
And it has a high cost , which the mill owners , who in truth are riverside woodsmen who have always lived there , do not have the money to cover .
For this reason they have to sell their production in anticipation to intermediaries , who resell it to Europe and the United States .
Close to 90 % of the production is exported .
They sell the extract in drums of 200 liters to the perfume houses at a price of US $ 300 per liter .
Before the producer sold his product to the intermediary for US $ 20 per liter .
Few manage to export directly to the industry without intermediaries .
When this happens , the producer receives US $ 60 per liter of oil .
The perfume houses in Brazil buy direct from the companies ' headquarters , since their purchases are centralized .
" it 's an enormous and complex chain , and who loses out is the producer , " adds Barata .
The partnership between the researcher and the producers resulted in a management and extraction plan of the oil from the leaves , which begins with the growing of rosewoods in a consortium with other growers .
As the plant needs to be protected from the sun during its initial life cycle , one of the solutions is to grow one tree every five meters interspersed with banana plants .
When the banana plants are ready for cutting , after some two years , the rosewood is at the phase in which is needs to receive direct sunlight .
The bananas can then be sold and other banana plants can be planted and removed again after two years .
At the start , before the seedlings of the rosewood are transplanted into the soil , they are acclimatized in nurseries protected by a covering of the leaves of the assai palm tree .
When the straw of this tree decomposes , the plants are more structured and ready to receive sunlight .
New pathways - In order for the project to be profitable , it is necessary to plant at least 10,000 seedlings of rosewood over thirty hectares .
The same number of seedlings that was planted in the growing area in the municipality of Nova Aripuanã .
Another 10,000 seedlings are in the nursery , awaiting the moment when they will be transferred to the field .
This quantity is almost thirty times more than would be necessary to plant according to the IBAMA decree .
For each drum of 200 liters exported the producer is obliged to plant eighty ) units of rosewood .
As Raul Alencar exports , on average , ten drums per year , he would have to plant only eight hundred ( 800 ) seedlings .
The project of sustainable development of the rosewood has already been presented at various international congresses and has awoken the interest of Brazilian entrepreneurs who , for now , do not wish their names to be revealed .
Many of them , who plant other crops , could also profit from the production of the essential oil of the rosewood .
And , if the native trees were to become extinct , the consumer market itself would be affected .
Before this happens , producers who have always lived off the forest 's resources are looking for new ways to extract what they need .
Sustainable development was the path chosen by the Amazon communities who live off the income from the extraction of the crabwood tree and the assai palm tree , for example , which prior to that decision ran the risk of becoming extinct .
Today the assai is important for its fruit , and not for its palm .
And the oil from the crabwood is the base of insect repellent candles and of many cosmetic products .
This is the same pathway that can be followed for the production of the essential oil from the leaves of the rosewood .
A classic in perfumes
Launched on the 5th of May 1921 , Chanel No.5 is successful until today .
A symbol of sophistication and elegance , the perfume was created by Ernest Beaux , considered to be one of the best perfumers of all time , at the request of Gabrielle Chanel , better known as Coco .
The stylist wanted a woman 's perfume , but different from the others on sale at that time and to be based on floral aromas .
The formula , as well as the essential oil of the rosewood , included jasmine from Grasse - a town in the region of Provence in France - , ylang-ylang , neroli oil ( oil extracted from the orange tree flowers ) , sandalwood and vetiver .
The composition was the first of the genre that mixed essences of flowers with aldehydes , substances obtained through chemical synthesis .
Eight decades after its launch , Chanel No. 5 continues being a classical perfume and at the same time contemporary .
There are controversies over the choice of the number 5 for the fragrance .
Some say that it was the lucky number of Mademoiselle Chanel , others that it was the fifth formula presented by the perfumer was chosen by her .
In 1959 , the design of the bottle , created by the glass manufacturer Brosse , entered into the Modern Art Museum of New York as a vanguard symbol .

Finite stock in the Amazon
Two species of tree take more than a century to grow and replace the quantity of cut wood
Marcos Pivetta
Simulations made by computer indicate that the commercial extraction of certain top class Amazonian trees might not be a sustainable activity in the long term .
Not even the adoption of the techniques recommended today for managing the forest , a group of measures , which in theory should reduce the effects of lumber activities upon the forest to acceptable levels , is capable of smoothing over the marks left by the human hand : rapid and effective , the chainsaw always wins out , and by a long way , the race against nature .
In the virtual scenarios , created in the micro computers of the researchers involved with the Dendrogene Project -- Genetic Conservation in the Managed Forests of the Amazon , the populations of two tree species , the tatajuba and the native variety of the West Indian bully tree , the maçaranduba , were submitted to a single cutting cycle , carried out in accordance with the concepts considered rational by current sustainable growth .
This situation was represented with the help of a ecology and genetics modeling program , named Eco-Gene , which calculated how long it would be necessary for the remaining trees of each species to re-grow and multiply and the forest to return to have the original quantity of tatajuba and maçaranduba trees .
The results have lit up an orange warning light : a century of tranquility was not sufficient to again endow the forest with the same stock of wood of the two species that they had previously .
The situation of the Bagassa guianensis , the scientific name of the scarce tatajuba tree , which produces a yellowish wood , much appreciated in the construction of boats and floorboards , is particularly worrying .
In the simulation , the forest needed some two hundred years to recover 80 % of the original quantity of wood .
The regeneration process was so slow that the species did not manage to recoup all of its initial stock .
More abundant , the Manilkara huberi , the popular maçaranduba tree , the owner of a very hard and resistant wood , dark red in color , had a better performance , but not very exciting : one hundred and thirty years were necessary for it to again exhibit the original quantity of wood .
" We need to review some ideas about wood exploration , " says Milton Kanashiro , a forestry engineer with Embrapa ( the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ) --Eastern Amazon , of Belem , who coordinated over a five-year period the work of approximately fifty researchers and collaborators in the Dendrogene Project .
" We have indications that , even with the adoption of management , in the framework practiced by companies today , there is a major reduction in the commercial stock of some tree species explored economically . "
Sun and shade -- The tatajuba and the maçaranduba trees are species of high commercial value from the Amazon , sometimes found side by side in areas of firm ground , as the strips of the forest lands that are never flooded are called .
In their maturity they reach forty to fifty meters in height cutting through the forest canopy .
They have thick trunks with diameters varying from 1.4 meters to 2.0 meters for adult examples , and their fruit are edible , especially that of the maçaranduba .
In spite of having points in common , the two species are conspicuous by the differences in their dynamics of reproduction and growth rate .
" One is the contrary of the other , " says the biologist Marivana Borges Silva , who is taking her doctorate degree at the Federal University of Pará ( UFPA ) , and who worked on the simulations .
In adult forests , the tatajuba is rare ; it loves sunlight and grows rapidly .
The maçaranduba is abundant , tolerates shade well and develops slowly .
In an area of 500 hectares of the National Forest of Tapajós , close to the town of Santarém , in Pará State , where the field work of the Dendrogene Project was concentrated , among the trees with more than 10 centimeters of diameter , the number of examples of the fist named species is ten times less than that of the second .
In this stretch of forest , close to fifty researchers and project collaborators , from here and abroad , have been studying in depth , for five years , the many varied aspects of biology and genetics of seven arboreal species , all of them explored by the lumber dealers .
As well as the tatajuba and maçaranduba trees , whose work is at the most advanced stage , the jatoba tree ( Hymenaea courbaril ) , the cumaru ( Dipteryx Odorata ) , the anani ( Symphonia globulifera ) , the andiroba ( Carapa guianensis ) and the parapara ( Jacaranda copaia ) are the targets of the researchers .
Each tree has occurrence and reproductive dynamics that are distinct from the others , forming , according to the scientists , a representative framework of a good part of the diversity of the arboreal species of Amazonia .
The main objective of the Dendrogene Project , a scientific enterprise to the tune of R $ 6 million funded mainly with resources from Embrapa itself and from the International Development Department of the British government , is to understand the greatest number possible of variables that influence in the birth , growth , death and regeneration of trees of commercial interest .
And , in this manner , design specific management plans for the groups of trees that show themselves capable of being explored over a long period of time .
" One of the problems of current management is to view the forest as something homogeneous , without taking into consideration the particularities of each species , " suggests Kanashiro .
" Our data , although preliminary , shows that forestry management could be viable if we to follow two pathways : reduce the intensity of extraction , diminishing the quantity of wood removed or elongate the cutting cycle , and promote rotation among the species that will be commercially explored in the future , concentrating activities on those with rapid growth . "
The problem is that it is still not known which species could be managed in a sustainable manner .
Hence the importance of having scientific projects that attempt to respond to this difficult question .
For now , it is not yet clear which type of management it would be possible to recommend for the exploration of the tatajuba and maçaranduba trees .
The analysis of another series of simulations carried out during the Dendrogene Project indicate that both cases are delicate .
With the help of the Eco-Gene program , which was fed with the biological and molecular data of the two species , the researchers compared the impact of the adoption of nine distinct scenarios of exploration over a period of three hundred ( 300 ) years .
The objective was to see if some change of behavior would produce significant reductions in the effects of the lumber activities on the populations of tatajuba and maçaranduba trees .
Once again , at the end of the simulations , there was nothing to commemorate : in all of the scenarios tested , even in the apparently least aggressive situations , there were no more trees remaining in sufficient enough quantity for commercial exploration after the third cycle of cuts .
" The results did not change much as a function of the adopted scenario , " comments Vânia Azevedo , who is taking her master 's degree at the University of Brasilia ( UnB ) , and who participated in the simulations .
" After the third cycle of cuts , it would not have been possible to take almost nothing from the forest . "
In each simulation , at least one of the three main parameters of the forestry management plan was altered .
These central directives define the interval of time between each extraction of the wood , the minimum diameter of the tree trunks that can be cut down and the percentage of trees that passed through the cut that were preserved ( left as reserve ) .
Among the few companies that have adopted management plans in the Amazon , where 70 % of the lumber extraction is irregular , according to some estimates , the standard adopted is to follow what the law demands : adopt a cycle cut of thirty years , to consider as a candidate for extraction , all of the trees with at least 45 centimeters in diameter at the so-called diameter at breast height ( DBH ) and to maintain as reserve only one in every ten trees that have attained the cutting point .
The first scenario tested served as a control .
In this case the Eco-Gene program calculated what would happen with populations of five hundred ( 500 ) tatajuba and five hundred ( 500 ) maçaranduba trees that would remain untouched over three centuries .
In the other scenarios , from the second to the ninth , distinct management plans were tested that were more or less restrictive to the lumber activity .
That of number two simulated exactly the parameters used today in management .
In the others the extraction cycle varied between 30 , 60 and 90 years , the minimum diameter for cutting oscillated between 45 , 55 and 65 centimeters and the section of the uncut trees left as reserve fluctuated between 10 % , 30 % and 50 % of the adult examples .
After some three hundred years of virtual exploration of the trees , the general picture painted by the Eco-Gene program was not good .
In relation to scenario number one , in which there were no cuts made at all of the wood , the tatajuba , and to a lesser extend the maçaranduba , showed in the other simulations significant reductions in stock of wood and in the number of trees that made up their respective populations .
The quantity of wood of B. guianensis available in the forest shrunk between 82 % and 90 % and the number of trees between 63 % and 78 % .
The stock of wood of M. huberi receded between 58 % and 80 % and the number of trees decreased at the maximum by 12 % .
It appeared that there had been a paradox -- or an error -- surrounding the two indices calculated by the modeling program for the maçaranduba tree .
How , after three centuries of exploration , can the number of trees of a species almost not diminish whilst the stock of the wood dwindles in front of our eyes ?
The answer : it 's true that at the end of the simulations there was almost the same number of maçaranduba trees as in the past , only that they were much smaller than before .
If the forestry management as it is practiced today radically alters the stock of wood in the forest , its impact upon the genetic diversity of the tatajuba and maçaranduba trees did not appear to have the same magnitude .
In both species , the loss of molecular information was at the maximum some 15 % of the so-called genotype combinations that there were in the trees before the start of the logging activity .
A genotype combination is a particular form of a gene found in an individual .
In other parameters , such as consanguinity , there were no statistically significant changes .
" The simulations indicate there are no strong threats to the genetic conservation of these trees , " ponders Kanashiro .
" But we can 't as yet say this with all certainty . "
Complex reality -- The results of the simulations need to be put into perspective .
The reality , everyone knows , above all the researchers involved with the Dendrogene Project , is more complex than the scenarios built up through a computer program that attempts to forecast the effects of the controlled extraction of wood .
The Eco-Gene program was fed with data about the genetic and biological characteristics of the tatajuba and maçaranduba trees studied in a natural area of the forest .
The ideal would be if the software were to be fed with information of trees coming from managed areas , which should present distinctive dynamic reproduction .
Shortly this should be possible .
At the end of 2003 , the researchers accompanied the cutting down of 90 % of the adult trees of the seven studied species that exist inside 500 hectares of the forest , in which the project had concentrated its fieldwork .
" Later this year , or in 2006 , I should be returning to the area to see the impact of the extraction of the wood upon the insects and animals responsible for the pollination of the trees , " says the biologist Márcia Motta Maués , from Embrapa-Eastern Amazon .
It may seem to be against common sense to the layman , but the extraction of wood stimulates the germination of seeds in the soil of Amazon and , in the first instance , favors the growth of seedlings of trees in the stretch of the forest that had been explored .
The cutting of a maçaranduba or a tatajuba of large size opens up a clearing in the sawed jungle and the rays of the sun strike the land more easily .
The forestry engineer , José do Carmo Alves Lopes , also from Embrapa , has measured at Tapajós the levels of regeneration of the seven studied species in detail during the Dendrogene Project , before and after having made the cutting down of trees there .
Ten months after the chainsaw had done its job , all of the varieties had increased their levels of regeneration .
The tatajuba , which loves sunlight , showed the highest index of appearance and growth of the little seedlings .
There were sixty two times more seedlings of the specie than before ( the number of off-shoots per hectare rose from 0.3 to 19.0 ) .
The crabwood , the species that had the lowest level of regeneration , increased more 5 % in its number of plantulas ( jumped from 106 off-shoots per hectare to 112 ) .
" Now we need to know how these growth levels will fit in over time .
They will drop off , but we just don 't know when , " affirmed engineer Carmo .
As the crown of the forest again becomes dense , species that do not tolerate shadow begin to show alarming levels of mortality .
Only the few examples that are tallest , which literally manage a permanent place in the sun , survive .
This is the situation of the tatajuba , contrary to the maçaranduba that likes the shadow .

Better management , more profit
Project rehabilitates small rural producers
Claudia Izique
In 2002 , Carlos Santim , the owner of an area a little larger that 30 hectares , in the municipality of Uirapuru , in the State of Sao Paulo , decided to substitute the coffee crop for a herd of cattle of seventy ) Dutch and mixed breed of cows that would produce 430 liters of milk per day .
Today , the small farm 's productivity , well above the average for the region , guarantees Santim an income of around ten minimum salaries ( R $ 3,000 ) and feeds him dreams of expansion .
He has just bought eight calves with resources coming from the National Program for the Strengthening of Family Agriculture ( Pronaf in he Portuguese acronym ) , of the Banco do Brasil , and aims to reduce costs with animal feed .
He has done his sums and guarantees : in 2006 he will reach a production of 7,000 liters of milk per day .
To those who suspect that the target is unattainable he reminds them that , in only two years his farm production grew almost seven times .
Maintaining this progress , Santim 's plans could even be conservative .
" I learned to manage the herd and to administer the property , " he explains .
The techniques of looking after the herd and of managing the business he learned from one of the two hundred and forty skilful personnel of the Coordination of Integral Technical Assistance ( Cati ) , who , for their part , were trained by specialists from the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ( Southeast Embrapa Cattle ) , within the environment of the project Family Agriculture -- Milk .
Created in 1999 and installed some two and a half years ago , the project has as its objective the transfer of knowledge concerning intensive production and milk yield for small farmers along with the techniques of rural extension .
The " class rooms " are small family farms , such as that of farmer Santim , in which Embrapa specialists discuss , analyze and evaluate agricultural and zootechnology practices together with the rural producers and Cati technicians .
" In the rural properties what 's missing most is information to produce milk in a simple manner , nevertheless profitable , and using concepts that are highly technical and environmentally sustainable , " affirmed Artur Chinelato de Camargo , a researcher at Southeast Embrapa Cattle , and one of the mentors of the project .
Uninformed , the small producers do not make use of basic practices , such as the analysis of the soil , control of milk yield , standard planted area or exams for identifying animal diseases .
Poorly fed , the herd will not have the productive potential and will not guarantee an income to the producers , who end up not looking after their property , before abandoning the activity and very often selling their land and moving to the city .
This was exactly the picture that the Cati technicians found with the majority of the one hundred and nine São Paulo farms in which they have already implanted the project .
" The first step is to promote a clean up in the area and to rescue the producer 's self-esteem , " says Adalberto Estivar , a Cati technician , responsible for the success of the farmer Santim enterprise .
The second step is to deal with changing the animal 's feed , substituting , whenever possible , the use of animal feed -- more expensive -- for grass .
" In order to produce milk it is not necessary to feed the cows exclusively with animal feed , " explains Estivar .
But , before that , one needs to teach the producers how to make fertilizer and how to manage pasture .
Grass guarantees the feeding of the animals with the production of twelve liters of milk per day .
Animal feed should only be used as a food supplement for the more productive animals .
The technical personnel recommend that , instead of buying the animal feed on the market , the producers should manipulate it , making use of seasonal products .
The result is that , instead of paying R $ 0.52 per kilo for conventional animal feed , he only spends R $ 0.30 .
From this stage on , the technicians initiate the work with the herd , with the identification of the productive animals and the discarding of those with poor efficiency .
" The investment has to come back in milk . "
The farm owners are also convinced to adopt cost planning , where they will religiously note down their incomes and expenditures on a daily basis .
" At the beginning , in order to reorganize the activity , they only have expenses and become dumfounded .
When the positive results begin to appear , they make plans for growth , " says Estivar .
The most delicate step is to induce them to adopt irrigation .
" This frightens the producers , " he justifies .
With irrigation the period of dry pasture reduces to some three months during which the grass can be substituted by corrected sugarcane , or that is , rich in protein and with added urea mineral .
Simple formulae -- The budget plans used by the farmers include simple formulae that allow for the accounting of equipment depreciation , interest payments on the capital invested in the land , a " salary " for the farmer , among others in such a manner that he can evaluate the profitability of the business .
" Little by little the farmers discover that the milk covers all of their investments . "
When the accounts are done , they verify that the production cost of each liter of milk -- sold for R $ 0.52 -- is R $ 0.32 .
" The gross profit is R $ 0.20 per liter of milk , " says Estivar .
" The model is logical , is economy of scale .
If the production were to be 50 liters per hectare / day , which is low , the farmer loses out .
He has to achieve 200 liters . "
In order to integrate themselves into the project captained by Embrapa , the farmers have some responsibilities to uphold on their part , explains r Chinelato : they have to leave the property " open " for visits by the local technicians , to carry out exams for brucellosis and tuberculosis on their animals every four months and discard any sick animals .
The project has the support of the farmers ' cooperative , cities , and , in some regions , of the Brazilian Support Service to Micro and Small Companies ( Sebrae ) .
" This is a cheap project with positive results , " underlines Chinelato .

Cleaning crew
Fungi and bacteria form the basis of detergents used in hospital equipment
Dinorah Ereno
Enzymes produced by a fungus and a bacterium form the basis of new detergents developed in Brazil and aimed at the cleaning of surgical instruments , unblocking probes with coagulated residues and digesting and dissolving organic remains , such as bloodstains and others .
The development of the products was done at the Biotechnology Center of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( CBiot / UFRGS ) , and coordinated by professor Marilene Henning Vainstein .
The use of detergents that contain enzymes -- proteins produced by human beings capable of stimulating chemical reactions without suffering alterations to their composition -- is nothing new .
But up until today , Brazil had not mastered the process of the industrial production of enzymes for the manufacture of detergents and , for this reason , had to import the raw material for making up the product .
" The main advantage in the composition of the detergents containing enzymes is their biodegradable characteristic , ideal for substituting caustic and acidic products , and solvents , which attack the environment and bring about wear and tear of material and instruments , " explains professor Marilene .
The first stage in the research consisted in the choice of the microorganisms that would be best suited for industrial use , since the researchers had been looking for bacteria that would produce protease , an enzyme of wide application in the food industry and in the manufacture of detergents , and of amylase , responsible for the degradation of starch molecules .
In order to arrive at them , various lineages of the species cited in scientific literature with the desired characteristics were tested .
" We knew that some species of the Aspergillus fungus are good producers of amylase , " says Marilene .
" This made our search easier . "
The selecting of the best microorganism to produce protease was also done in the same manner .
" A collection of bacteria of the genre Bacillus was tested in order to make a choice of an excellent producer of proteases , which was what he had needed . "
With the choice of the fungus and the bacterium , the researchers then needed to develop a production process that , at the same time , would present a satisfactory yield and would be of low cost , so that it could be applied industrially .
Various substances were tested in order to make up the composition of the culture , which contains the elements nitrogen and carbon as well as mineral salts and nutritional additives that cannot be revealed .
As soon as this phase was completed , the Rio Grande do Sul research group requested a patent for the production process of protease and amylase for industrial applications .
Proteases represents 60 % of the total commerce of enzymes in the world within a market estimated at US $ 1 billion .
As well as the detergent and food industries , they are used in the treatment of leather , in the substitution of toxic compounds and pollutants .
The adoption of biological processes in tanneries has as its main objective a cost reduction in the treatment of effluent resulting from the chemical processes .
Amylases are used in industry to break down starch molecules , originating substrates that are important in the preparation of glucose and maltose syrups or mixtures , bakeries , breweries and the production of ethanol .
In the manufacture of detergents they are used to remove residues .
The diversified use of enzymes is related to their characteristics of performing as specific bio-catalysts , which are substances that modify the reaction rate of a chemical reaction .
The development at the university originated from a request made by entrepreneurs in the town of Cachoeirinha , in Rio Grande do Sul State .
Newton Mário Battastini and Ivete Casagrande Battastini are partners in the companies Tecfarm and Tecpon , which import enzymes from a Danish firm in order to produce detergents for hospital cleaning that are sold here in Brazil .
The proposal for the study and the production of these enzymes was made to the veterinarian Sydnei Mitidieri Silveira , who had published work on the theme .
He then started work on his doctorate degree through the Post Graduation Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology at the Biotechnology Center of UFGRS and took the idea to professor Marilene .
At the same time , during 2000 , a tender was published by the Research Support Foundation of Rio Grande do Sul ( Fapergs ) supporting interactions between universities and companies .
The coincidence of interests led to the presentation of a project to the foundation for the development of enzymes , which was approved .
The companies entered with part of the resources necessary for research .
" The initial idea was to work on the development of yet another enzyme , lipase , which degrades lipids , but as yet we have not managed the expected results , " says Marilene .
All of the part of the development of enzymes for industrial application is now ready .
The company named Enzi-Far , an arm of Tecfarm and Tecpon that is being housed at the CBiot Entrepreneurial Incubator of the university , is now working on the optimization of the industrial production scale .
" The company is producing 400 liters of these enzymes per week , which are being used for various formulae and stability tests , " says Marilene .
" As soon as we accelerate the production , the companies can start to sell the biodegradable detergents to hospitals . "
In the future , other formula recipes could be made up making use of the same enzymes for the treatment of sewers , leathers and in the cleaning up of bakery residues .
For this to occur , only a few adjustments will need to be done in the process of making up the formula because all of the production scale process had already been mastered .

Company develops precision equipment for use in agriculture
A technological leap and an increase in revenues .
These were the fruits collected by the company named DLG Automação , from the town of Sertãozinho , which was counted upon the collaboration of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) to develop precision apparatus principally directed towards the agricultural market .
The first device to be ready was a piece of equipment that determines the level of compactness of farm land soil , a useful measurement for crops to grow strong and with high productivity .
As well , a second device is in the final development phase of a system for generating a differential correction system , in real time , for receptors of the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .
The objective is to reduce the imprecision of the system 's receptors that indicate , by way of satellite signals , terrestrial coordinates such as latitude and longitude .
This project was highlighted at the Gerdau Best in the Land Awards of 2004 , dedicated to the agricultural machinery and equipment industry , winning in the category of Research and Development .
" Through the research and development work to project and develop this device , we managed to master a new technology , that of microprocessor apparatus , and to diversify our line of products .
With this we reached new markets and our revenues income rose from R $ 200,000.00 in 1997 , the year in which the company was founded , to R $ 1.4 million in 2004 , " says Glauco Guaitoli , a director of DLG , which also manufactures automation systems and equipment for various industrial segments .
In the opinion of the agricultural engineer Nelson Luís Cappelli , from the Agricultural Engineering Faculty ( Feagri ) of Unicamp , who coordinated two of the company 's projects funded through FAPESP 's Small Business Innovation Research ( PIPE ) program , the development of the equipment will help to resolve certain technological bottlenecks for the wider use in agriculture of precision instrumentation in the country .
The analyzer of soil compaction , known as a penetrometer , is identified as PNT-2000 and is the only electronic , portable and geo-referenced model produced in Brazil .
" The imported models have a very high cost of around US $ 5,000.00 , while ours sells for R $ 5,000.00 , " the researcher explains .
As well as showing the level of soil compaction , it reveals the depth of the compacted layers and their spatial location .
" Compacted soil damages the growth of plants because it holds back the development of roots and their better fixation , as well as lowering the level of the absorption of water and nutrients , " says Cappelli .
The PNT-2000 demonstrates advantages in relation to other devices available on the market because the process of the acquisition and storage of the data is all automatic .
" In conventional penetrometers the user needs to carry out annotations at each point , whilst in ours the data remains stored in the equipment itself , " says the engineer Claudio Kiyoshi Umezu , who also participated in the creation of the product .
" Furthermore , as our equipment provides geographical coordinates , the user does not need to make a topographical map to identify the localities of the sampling points , " he said .
The geo-referencing ( the exact determination of latitude and longitude ) depends on the use of a GPS receptor , linked to the equipment .
The working of the penetrometer is relatively simple .
As well as a unit for storing the information , the device has a metal shaft of 60 centimeters in length , with a small metallic cone at its extremity .
In order to know if the soil is compacted , the user introduces the shaft into the earth and a force sensor measures the resistance to penetration of the shaft into the earth .
The data collected reveals the level of compacting of the land .
The device also has a distance sensor , using ultra sound , which measures how much of the shaft was introduced into the soil .
This sensor allied to the positioning obtained by way of the GPS , makes it possible to construct 3-dimensional maps of the agricultural soil .
" This is an apparatus that is of major use in areas of reforestation and of growing crops using intense mechanization , and which have a high index of compaction , such as sugarcane plantations and soya fields , " says Guaitoli .
Right from the start of its commercialization , in 2002 , eight units of the apparatus were sold to universities , research institutions and a reforestation company in the south of the state of Bahia .
According to the researcher , this is the first device of this type that is manufactured in the country .
" We decided to create this system in order to lower the cost of equipment and thus make the technology available to a larger number of possible users . "
The imported system costs at the minimum US $ 8,000.00 , a price a lot higher than the DLG equipment , which should have its price defined by the launch date , forecast for the end of the year .
In order to understand the operation of a DGPS station , one first needs to know how the GPS system works .
This system , created in the decade of the 1970s by the American government , makes use of a constellation of twenty-four satellites positioned around about 20,000 kilometers in altitude .
For a considerable time it was only used for military ends until , in 1995 , it began to be opened up for civil use , then with a signal error intentionally introduced of between 100 and 140 meters .
Starting from the year 2000 , the American authorities , with the objective of widening its commercial use , decided to deactivate the uncertainty of the signal and to leave the system with its original level of imprecision , of around 15 meters .
In order to reduce this error , it is necessary to resort to the DGPS , which consists in a fixed base located at a known geo-referenced point .
Thus whoever , possesses a GPS receptor can capture the DGPS signal .
The error then drops to 2 meters .
The DLG device possesses a GPS receptor base and a correction processor responsible for the identification of the error size .
The information on the error is sent by means of a radio transmitter to the mobile localized GPS , for example , on tractors or combine harvesters .
Currently in Brazil there exist few options for the correction of the signal , as well as being expensive and very often having receptors that are imprecise .
" Our DGPS is going to reduce the error to something like 2 meters and can be used with almost all of the GPS receptors , " says Cappelli .

A different type of magnet
Graphite developed by a Brazilian and Uruguayan research team has magnetic properties
Yuri Vasconcelos
Researchers from the Federal University of Sao Carlos ( UFSCar ) and the University of the Republic ( Udelar ) , in Montevideo , Uruguay , have managed to transform a pure organic and non-metallic element -- carbon graphite-- into a magnet by way of a cheap chemical treatment .
The new material opens up pathways for the manufacture of magnetic devices such as sensors and detectors used in areas that run from space engineering to medicine .
Up until now European researchers have been able to manage this feat , but by using techniques that are much more expensive and complex , as is the case of the method developed by a German research team that made use of bombarding using a proton beam , generated by a nuclear reactor , in order to produce the magnetism in the graphite .
" Besides being a much more expensive and complex process , and as yet not totally explained , the magnetism obtained by them is approximately ten times smaller than that of our carbon , " explains one of the inventors , the materials engineer Fernando Manuel Araújo-Moreira , a professor at the Physics Department of UFSCar , and the coordinator of the work in Brazil .
The importance of the invention lies in the fact that , for some time now , the scientific community believed that a magnetic material must by obligation contain atoms of metallic elements such as iron , cobalt and nickel .
Research carried out by scientists from the Brazilian and Uruguayan universities has demonstrated the contrary because the graphite only possesses carbon atoms .
" We confirmed in the arrangement of the carbon atoms , which is the basic element of all organic structures , a new property , that of magnetism , " advised professor Araújo-Moreira .
The patent for the invention , named Process for the preparation of magnetic graphite materials and materials thus prepared , was requested by the Foundation of Institutional Support of UFSCar at the National Industrial Property Institute ( INPI ) and has as co-title holders the two universities .
The list of inventers include , as well as professor Araújo-Moreira , the doctorate student Helena Pardo and professor Álvaro Mombrú , the coordinator of the work in Uruguay .
The new material has also had repercussions in the business world .
The UFSCar researchers are in negotiations with the Brazilian company named Nacional de Grafite , with its head office in the town of Itapecerica , in Minas Gerais State .
The company is the major world manufacturer of natural graphite crystals with a capacity to produce 46,000 tons per year , half of which is sold to clients abroad .
" The agreement forecasts the investment of around R $ 300,000.00 for the continuity of our research , now on an industrial scale , looking towards technological applications , " says Araújo-Moreira .
The research for obtaining organic materials with magnetic properties is very recent and was only initiated at the beginning of the last decade .
According to the UFSCar researcher , up until today scientists throughout the entire world have been asking themselves if it was possible to produce a purely organic material with magnetic properties .
" Some groups have already managed to synthesize organic compounds endowed with magnetism , however only in microscopic quantity and with very weak signals , which placed the results in doubt , " says Araújo-Moreira .
" Our team has managed to manufacture macroscopic quantities of magnetic graphite , which , although very small , can be seen with the human eye .
As well as this , this new material is endowed with ferromagnetism , a property that guarantees it to have permanent magnetism and the capacity of attracting metals .
Another proof of this is that it is strongly attracted by a magnet at a distance of around 10 centimeters , " he advised .
The ferromagnetism of the graphite produced by the UFSCar and Udelar researchers also has the advantage of maintaining itself stable at room temperature .
This is important because all magnets obtained from carbon in the past only presented ferromagnetism at very low temperatures , close to absolute zero ( -273 ° C ) , which had limited its field of application .
The material discovered by the teams of professors Mombrú and Araújo-Moreira is stable over a temperature range because it possesses a magnetic signal that does not suffer degradation with the passing of months .
The sample of 0.5 square millimeters ( 0.5 mm2 ) by the researchers in May of 2004 has continued with its magnetism unaltered during the following ten months of it having been synthesized .
This property is fundamental for the construction of devices and equipment of high durability .
If the research results , done on the laboratory scale , were to be highly successful on the industrial scale , the discovery of a graphite with magnetic properties should trigger a new phase in materials engineering .
As it is a recently discovered material , it is not yet known exactly in which areas it can be applied .
The researchers believe that the material can be used in a large number of high technology devices , as sensors , activators ( devices that move in a production line of semi-conductors or on banks of clinical analyses , for example ) , detectors , as well as equipment in the aerospace , chemical and electronics sectors , as well as in telecommunications and biotechnology .
By being , for now , the only 100 % biocompatible magnetic material , the magnetic graphite also has chances of being used in medicine .
" Pacemakers and cardiac valves are based on magnetic processes and a 100 % organic material , which does not cause rejection in the human organism and is magnetic , would allow new advances with the devices , " advised professor Araújo-Moreira .
" Furthermore , Canadian researchers are beginning to research the use of magnetic graphite for the treatment of cancer . "
Accepted for publication in the month of March by the scientific magazine Physical Review B - Rapid Communications , the study has already produced good repercussions .
" If it is proven that the results are reproductive and that the sample does not contain iron impurities , this is a major discovery in the area of materials science , " says the Russian researcher Tatiana Makarova , from the Umea University , in Sweden , considered to be one of the top researchers in the area of magnetic carbon .
" The differences between the magnetic carbon produced by professor Araújo-Moreira and other similar materials are in the primary magnetic effect and in the fact that his production method is cheap , " she stated .
The next challenge for the scientists is to demonstrate that it is possible to produce magnetic carbon with the same characteristics -- strong signal at room temperature and stable over a long period of time -- in large quantities and to develop an industrial process .
In the negotiations with the company Nacional de Grafite also forecast is joint work to be submitted to research development agencies with the objective of developing supports for catalysts based on magnetic carbon .
These supports would be used to accelerate chemical reactions that generate chemical products .
Simple and economical -- In order to manufacture the magnetic graphite , Araújo-Moreira and his colleagues made use of an unprecedented process , different from all of those that had been done up until then .
" We 're dealing with a very simple method in a controlled chemical process of oxidation-reduction in the vapor phase , which , by being economical and using low cost commercial reagents , would allow , in the future , its manufacture and commercialization by small companies . "
The production in the laboratory is done in an oven with controlled atmosphere , where two crucibles ( ceramic receptacles that withstand high temperatures ) , one of them with commercial graphite in powder form and the other with an oxide of a metal , such as , for example , copper oxide ( CuO ) .
The oven is maintained hot at 1,200 ° C during twelve to sixteen hours .
At this temperature the copper oxide decomposes and is reduced to copper metal .
The liberated oxygen brings about the controlled oxidation of the graphite and introduces into its structure small defects , in the form of cavities , which , the researchers assume , are responsible for conferring magnetic properties to the mineral .
" In truth , the origin of the phenomenon of magnetism in this material has not yet be fully explained , " adds professor Araújo-Moreira .
The researcher pointed out that the most recent data obtained by way of computer simulations indicates the appearance of strong ferromagnetism as a consequence of the lack of carbon atoms in the atomic structure typical of graphite .
The simulation removed an atom of carbon and it became magnetic .
In the laboratory , probably the absence of these carbon atoms in the graphite structure is achieved by way of a chemical attack .
The discovery of the new material is the result of three years of intense research .
" Everything began in 2001 , during the post-doctorate work of the Uruguayan researcher Álvaro Mombrú at the Physics Department of UFSCar , under my supervision .
It was then that the idea that we study the physical and chemical properties of graphite was born , from which was derived the discovery of the chemical process that led to obtaining magnetic graphite , " recalls Araújo-Moreira .
During that year , the American scientific magazine Nature published an article that showed the possibility of the manufacture of a variation of pure carbon that would be magnetic .
The third integrant of the team , the Uruguayan chemist Helena Pardo , is currently studying for her doctorate degree at the Physics Institute of the Chemical School of the University of the Republic of Montevideo , Uruguay , under the double supervision of professors Araújo-Moreira and Mombrú .
Detailed description -- In order to certify that the material produced really had unique characteristics , the team submitted the sample to an extensive battery of tests , carried out at the Semiconductor Laboratory of the Physics Department of UFSCar , work carried out by the researcher Giovanni Zanelato , and at the Inter-Disciplinary Laboratory of Electrochemistry and Ceramics ( Liec ) , with professor Édson Leite , from UFSCar , and with the collaboration of professor Oscar Ferreira de Lima , from the Materials and Low Temperatures Laboratory ( LMBT ) of the Physics Institute of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) .
The experiment carried out in this last mentioned laboratory , made with a Squid magnetometer ( Superconducting Quantum Interference Device ) measured the variation of magnetization of the material with temperature .
This test demonstrated that the graphite 's magnetism remained up until 80 ° C .
Besides the laboratory examinations that demonstrated the effectiveness of the chemical method , the sample was submitted to chemical analysis with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer that verified the purity of the material , verifying the absence , in undesirable levels , of any ferromagnetic metallic impurities such as iron , cobalt and nickel .
A complementary examination by a sweep electronic microscope confirmed the existence of these cavities in the graphite , brought about by chemical attack .
Finally , observations carried out with a microscope of atomic and magnetic forces shows , in images bi and tri-dimensional , the existence of magnetic trails in the graphite , characteristics of ferro-magnetic metals , that is material that attract metals .

They sit on the throne of Saint Peter , but their concerns are really with Saint Paul , the first " missionary " who journeyed to the " pagans " to bring to them Christ 's message .
" We must be missionaries , animated by a Holy Restlessness : to take the gift of faith to all .
The love of God was given to us so that we may pass it to others .
We receive faith so that we can bestow it on others , " announced Pope Benedict XVI in his first sermon to his Cardinals , one day after having been elected Pope .
Distant from theological subtleties , the missionaries have even influenced lay society : it was not without reason that , because of land disputes , a American nun was shot dead in the Amazon .
Missionary action is a complex issue -- especially so at the start of the 16th century , with the Jesuits , in recently discovered Portuguese America , grouped together with the native Indians -- and continues up until today to worry the Church .
" John Paul II made an effort to be the great missionary , " observes Paula Montero , the coordinator of the thematic project entitled , Christian missionaries in the Brazilian Amazon : a study of cultural mediation , funded by FAPESP .
But in spite of this symbolic labor of the Vatican , since the 70s , missionary intervention into the indigenous peoples has been seen in a dualist manner , like a cultural shock with winners and losers ( or those who exchanged their culture ) .
" This encounter was not just decimating , but brought about the establishment of relationships between cultures , " the researcher reveals .
" One of the major questions that is placed in front of us today is how to understand the subtle process through which the differences , which supposedly would be condemned to disappear , before globalization , are recreated and reinvented .
In our research , we became interested , above all , in perceiving this dynamic process of cultural redefinition , when mediated by a particular social player : the Christian missionary , " explains Marco Rufino , from the project team , whose results will be published in a book by Editora Globo .
" Thus , the focus of reflection has moved , from the point of view of the indigenous societies to position itself in the production spaces of interaction relationships ; this means trying to understand how two ( or more ) points of view interact to produce shared meanings at more and more generalizing levels , " the coordinator explains .
" One further reason for returning to the history of the missions : as emblematic history of the multicultural structure of modern times , since they came up with the first ethnographic study on alteration , whose historic value transcends the " religious " dimension and , on the other hand , they constituted an archeology of all the human sciences that , by way of shock encounters between diverse civilizations , have continued relating man 's pathway and the " meaning " that they endeavored to give to their lives , " evaluates Nicola Gasbarro , another member of the team .
" Truly and factually , they were the first anthropologists of modern times , " the researcher completes .
Curiously enough , the missionary movement -- that changed considerably throughout history and , contrary to common sense , was not just am arm of the colonizing State ( though at times their interests overlapped ) , but more endowed by its own freewill -- has its origin in the desire for the universality of Christianity by setting itself up as the " the true cult of the true God . "
Within this movement , the Church is structurally missionary , notes Gasbarro .
" The missions are a practice of evangelism that allows moving from potential universality to actual and current universality . "
At the bottom of this structure lies the concept of salvation , the organizer of differences as it gathers under its " spiritual greatness , " the plurality .
Everybody , even Indians , are men and need to be saved .
" The grand missionary project of the Counter Reform was born from a cultural urgency : the West attempting to understand other cultures in terms of ' civilization ' and ' religion ' , because they were dealing with the fundamental structures of social life , " the researcher observed .
Religion became the constructor of reality .
The discovery of the new peoples of the New World , was a golden chance for the Church to put into practice the new concept of " salvation " as a universalizing amalgam .
However , from theory to practice there was a whole ocean separating the Jesuits and the native Indians .
The Christian monotheistic model existed in opposition to ancient classical paganism : The only God needed rivals in order to exhibit his greater power .
The problem was that the religiousness of the Indians did not serve the purpose : they essentially had not believed in great superior forces .
This marked the start of a long and arduous " translation " of religion ( which explains why , before the coming of the catechism , there was the need for writing down the natives ' grammar ) and of bargaining between the two cultures .
At the same time , it was necessary to make the Indian a civilian so that he could then receive the spiritual gift .
" Therefore , the start of the catechism deals with the idea of turning the Indians into ' men ' ( = civilian ) so that afterwards they could become Christians , an idea that accompanied all of the evangelical situations in colonial Brazil , " says Cristina Pompa , also one of the project 's researchers .
Thus , from this situation one can no longer speak about the meeting between missionaries and the indigenous population as " a shock between two monolithic blocks , one imposing its cultural schemes and religion and the other absorbing them , being destroyed by them ( or exchanging their culture ) , or on the other hand , ' resisting ' in the face of their immovable tradition , " the author continues .
This means the production of a negotiated consensus .
" There is the calculation of the Indian as well with respect to relationships with the missionaries , and quite simply one cannot speak of a fusion of cultures , but in a grouping of relationships that were agreed around some common interests that ended up producing inter-cultural relationships , " explains Paula Montero .
Tupã became the equivalent of the Christian monotheistic God , Our Lady was transformed into Tupansy and the " pajés " ( medicine men ) became the devils .
" European imagery constructed the indigenous alterations starting from a revision and a re-articulation of some religious categories : faith , prophecy , demonic sphere .
Starting from that , the missionary project was built upon .
Parallel to this , the ' other ' indigenous had carried out his reading of the colonizing and missionary alterations , attempting to absorb them and place them in accordance with his categories : mythical-ritual symbolism , " continued Cristina .
Right from the start , irrefutable polarity had not been observed , but a game , a " translation , " in the search for a common plateau , a dimension of symbolic transition that had in " religion " its language of mediation .
Without denying the truculence with which the native Indians were treated , the project reveals that even " adhesion to the use of Christian symbols explains the historic dynamism through which the indigenous population searched for instruments of political affirmation in the colonial world , constructing a symbolic universe shared by other social players and re-constructing with them a new hierarchy of social and power relationships . "
But new times followed and a new Church asked for a new missionary .
From the 19th century on , the indexation is inverted : civilization becomes the world 's new generalizing code in the place of " salvation . "
" Throughout the 20th century a new notion of culture was consolidating itself , redefined by the political feuds of the 19th and 20th centuries towards a grouping of specifically hereditary traits , " explains Paula .
In the years after 1970 , missionaries became culturalist agents .
" The religious field was relatively neutralized as a legitimate field of translation , the native culture understood as ritual , ceremony and traditions , had already been built up as such in the eyes of these players .
The field of translation could thus leave the grammar of religion and adopt the field of ' culture ' ( of ethnic or ethnicized identity ) as the language for the negotiation of feelings , " the coordinator observed .
" In the years after 1970 , the code of salvation of the missionaries moved from spiritualism ( a soul to be converted ) to cultural ( a tradition to be saved ) , without losing its capacity of organizing feelings . "
All of this reversion consolidated itself , during the 60s , with the Second Vatican Council : in an attempt to incorporate into a Europeanizing institution the many non-European bishops , the Church assumed in its vocabulary the anthropological concept of culture .
At the first instant , this was taken to the extreme , especially by the ideologists of the so-called Liberation Theology , during the 70s , which " symbolically brought together , " observes Rufino , " the indigenous groups throughout the continent and the factory workers , field hands , banished farmers , blacks victimized by prejudice , to the marginalized populations of urban centers , along with anyone else covered by the wide grouping of excluded peoples . "
The religious model of conversion fell into decline .
" The new idea of converting the Indian is to support him in his political fights .
The missionary is now the converted , only in the questions of the survival of the Indian , " Paula noted .
The pontificate of Pope John Paul II marked the turning point of this " ortho-practical " movement of the reunion of faith and praxis .
A severe critic , ( at the side of the then cardinal Ratzinger ) , John Paul II defended a new missionary ideal under the banner of " in-cultural involvement , " a dive not into social problems , but into alteration .
The missionary is re-invented and the Church intends to be absorbed in many diversities .
" Pope John Paul II placed the cultural question at the center of his pontificate .
Hence the importance of his travels , in which the Church was immersed in the differences in an attempt to find a common denominator .
The pilgrimages become the element of unification of the diversities , " the researcher states .
In this manner , Pope John Paul II was truly a great missionary .
Spiral -- The dilemma of today 's religions is to revert to the past , in a curious and unusual spiral of time : in order that the Indian can be saved , it is necessary that he returns to recover the traits that would again bring him back to his alteration as an Indian .
Thus , the new missionaries move in the reverse direction to their antecedents , those who brought civilization to the natives .
Now it is necessary to teach them again how to be indigenous .
This is the new discourse of the new moment of the movement .
But the reflux of Catholicism has brought other religions onto the scene ( Protestants , Universals , Baptists , the Assembly of God , etc . ) who have also resolved to " look after " the Indian .
These are the so-called " trans-cultural missions , " which , Ronaldo de Almeida notes ( also a member of the team ) , " have announced Evangelism to the cultures , remodeling the universe of values , rituals and behavior in accordance with the parameters of fundamentalist evangelical religiosity . "
Interventionists , they have ended up coming close to the colonial Jesuit model and , contrary to the to the Catholic in-cultural involvement , do not show any interest in helping the political fight of the indigenous Indians , but only in the religious aspect itself .
" Many missionaries tend to transform themselves into social service assistants , into humanitarian organization workers , perhaps even into apostles of political revolutions .
They remain silence as far as the announcement of Evangelism as to the hope of eternal life , they speak nothing of the need for Baptism in order to participate in this promise .
We have reached the point of discouraging conversions to Christianity , inverting the role of the missionary " : words of the then cardinal Joseph Ratzinger .
" I believe that the arrival of Benedict XVI coincides with the end of the cycle of the potentiality of the Second Vatican Council .
He is a theologian and has already given notice that he doesn 't intend to run around the world like the previous Pope .
The development of the cultural question continues central within the new pontificate , but will remain in the scheme of reflection , of doctrine , and not that of ritual , as occurred with Pope John Paul II , who went out of his way to encounter other cultures , " evaluates Paula .
He has shown himself disposed to open himself up to the other , she adds , " but looking to an ethical universality of the human condition to go beyond the cultural diversities . "
Nothing leads us to think anything else from the man who , in Dominus Iesus , a document written by him in 2000 as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith , negated that other religions in the world , which are not Christian , could offer salvation to their peoples .
" To convert the people to Catholicism is an urgent duty , " he then proclaimed .

The lobby goes up to the Presidential Palace
Studies reveal the relationship between the Legislative and Executive branches and the interests pressure groups
Carlos Haag
It was of a prosaic cooling of heels in the 19th century that today 's ill-famed lobby was born : representatives of farmers from the state of Virginia , in the USA , had planted themselves in the lobbies of Congress , to influence the decisions of the politicians with the pressure of their talk .
Over here , some caught sight of its still incipient presence in the processing of laws like the one that created Petrobras ( " The petroleum is ours " ) or the Statute of the Rural Worker .
But lobbying grew even in another age .
" Its development occurred in the mid-1970s , when the country was under the military regime , which centralized the decision taking process on the Executive branch , weakening the Legislative , " tells Andréa Cristina de Jesus Oliveira , the author of the survey Lobby e representação de interesses [ Lobby and representation of interests ] , carried out at Unicamp .
Far from a mere wait to apply pressure , the lobbying of the Brazilian Executive branch was based on the purchase of accesses and results , by means of corruption and the traffic of influence .
Nothing better could be expected of a dictatorship , and the practice was transformed into a popular jargon term for " shady business . "
The odd thing is that the " evil " that had grown in the corridors of the Planalto palace ( Presidential Palace ) had its apogee with the country 's democratization .
" From 1985 onwards , there was the strengthening of the National Congress as a political power and , hence , of the pressure groups , which took their place in the democratic process again , " she says .
From that , a strange truth : " The lobbying activity , regardless of the format that it takes on , is essential in democratic societies , because the decision makers are confronted with a complex network of interests and the technical information that the lobbyists take to them is fundamental , for providing input for their analysis about the best path to follow .
It is transformed into a social force for bringing closer civil society and the State , " the researcher believes .
Andréa recognizes , though , that it is not easy to remove the stigma from the practice .
" Corruption , illegitimate lobbying , has always existed and will continue to exist while there is not a serious debate involving society and government about the limits of the work of the lobbyists in Brazil , " she warns .
In the USA , for example , lobbying , an activity included in the exercise of freedoms provided for in the First Amendment , has been regulated since 1946 .
Here , in 1983 , the then senator Marco Maciel present the bill 6132 , still not voted , which provides for the registration of private individuals or corporate bodies that exercise any activity that influences the legislative process .
" It is , though , no more than a translation of the American law of 1946 .
Our lobbying has peculiarities that it does not take into account , " she explains .
Amongst these , the concomitance of the focus of activity : the path of the traffic of influence or of information .
" The way of corruption is expensive and without guarantees .
The pressure group is subject , every time the issue starts showing risks or opportunities again , to have to resume spurious relations , and more money will be spent .
Furthermore , in Brazil , the Executive branch competes in power with the Legislative branch : 85 % of the 5 thousand projects are proposed by it .
" The majority of the lobbyists that I interviewed are favorable to the regulation of lobbying , and there are even initiatives , in the light of the lack of interest of the parliamentarians , to create self-regulation of the practice .
For them , a debate on the reality of lobbying will put an end to the stigma and will clarify for public opinion its real significance , " she considers .
Those contrary to a legislation are just more pessimistic as to the results .
" They argue that there is no way of guaranteeing the end of corruption and that law merely brings less liberty to legitimate work . "
Executive branch -- The big question , then , is the lack of interest of the parliamentarians .
" There is no political will for regulation , whether in the Executive branch or in the Legislative branch .
After all , the parliamentarians themselves often fulfill the role of lobbyists when they intermediate the release of budgetary funds for states or municipalities or sectors which they defend or of which they are part , " says Andréa .
" In Congress , there are parliamentarians that are owners of health insurance plans , universities , agribusinesses , industries etc .
The law on lobbying would remove the freedom of action that they have today , " she explains .
It was the Constituent Assembly that brought the pressure groups back to the Legislative branch .
" Many say that , at the time , there were more lobbyists than congressmen during the debates on the Constitution .
There were 383 accredited pressure groups , amongst them the ' lipstick lobby ' , a group that defended feminist causes and issues like maternity leave , abortion and child custody , amongst others , that were furthered in a decisive manner , with the help of this team , " she recalls .
According to the author , other projects were approved with the decisive participation of pressure groups , in the course of the 1980s , such as the increase in the social security contribution , the protection of the market in information technology , the statute of the microbusiness etc .
The lobby is not always " for ill . "
Even though this theory works sometimes , it is not always perfect .
Any interest group can get together and set up a strategy for lobbying in the Congress .
However , an action like this implies sizeable investments , and not all have financial conditions and structure for the practice .
This alone leads to an imbalance in the sphere of the representation of interests .
One good example is the disparity between the lobbying of the National Federation of Industry ( CNI ) , which represents business interests , with vast resources , and the lobbying of the Inter-union Parliamentary Advisory Department ( Diap ) , which depends on the monthly dues from its associates to maintain itself , " observes Andréa .
This difference , by the way , is the theme of another survey , Lobby da indústria no Congresso Nacional [ Lobby of industry in the National Congress ] , by Wagner Pralon Mancuso , from USP , which relied on support from FAPESP .
According to data researched by the professor , the productive classes , since 1996 , have made 233 proposals for alterations to the law reach the Chamber and Congress , of which 67.8 % were accepted by the members of parliament .
Amongst the laws and constitutional amendments approved , 85 % of them met the desires of the major Brazilian industries .
When one analyzes the structure of the victories , the business pressure group 's firepower can be perceived : 79.3 % were on questions connected with infrastructure ; 74 % on labor legislation ; 62.5 % under the heading of financing ; 61.4 % of successes on regulating the economy ; even on the tax question , in which they have less influence , they won 56.4 % of the issues voted .
And , personally , they make a good number : there are 100 members of parliament that present themselves as businessmen and , when joining up with another 150 politicians who align themselves with them , the business bench achieves quite a lobby : 250 parliamentarians , against 50 politicians from the trade union bench .
" My thesis clashes with those who sustain that industry in Brazil has a position of political weakness and represent the businessmen from the sector as unfit for collective action , attributing this to the presence of the corporative system of representing interests , " he reckons .
Success - " Industry has not only been capable of identifying draft laws referring to ' Brazil cost ' and of defining and defending its point of view in relation to them , but has also achieved great success , " he observes .
The various historical and sociological currents had for decades been denouncing the incapacity of the industrial sector for heading up a project of independent economic development for the country , as if they lived split asunder by incompatible visions of the world and interests .
From the 1990s , though , with the liberal inflection and the withdrawal of the State , Mancuso analyzes , the Brazilian business class took up the banner of the reduction of Brazil cost ( a set of factors that impairs the competitiveness of Brazilian companies over the foreign ones : labor laws , lack of infrastructure and high taxes , amongst other factors ) as a way of transforming itself into an efficient political player .
The arrival of imported products onto the market , with the new wave of liberalism , ended up causing this strange encounter of interests of the industrial sector , which started to seek competitiveness more emphatically , by means of lobbying with the Executive and Legislative branches .
" Hence , even recognizing the structural limits of the Brazilian industrial bourgeoisie , my survey sustains that the producers carried out an intense , and often very successful , political activity , throughout all the stages of the process of industrialization , and , today , continue to act and to reap some important successes , " notes the author .
By means of a professionalized CNI ( in the Constituent Assembly , it fared badly in its lobbying ) for pressure , the industrialists started to carry out a constant work of identifying and monitoring legislative propositions that would have an impact on Brazil cost .
" It is important to understand that the clamor of the industrialists for reducing the Brazil cost was not motivated merely by the desire to face up to the foreign competitors .
The interest in the domestic market also played its role .
For the industrial businessmen , the conquest of new markets abroad cannot dispense with the beneficent outcome that the reduction of the Brazil cost would exert on the competitiveness of their companies . "
In its Legislative Agenda for 2000 , the CNI assumes " the practice of an open and permanent lobby , " whose priority target , Mancuso notes , is the Executive branch .
In the proportion that business decisions determine , in great measure , the profile of the economy , there is , the author notes , " in the decisions of the State , special deference and attention to the needs of the business class .
Just like the politicians , the population perceives that their own fate is tied up with the fate of the businessmen , " he says .
" The law on bankruptcies and the alteration to bill 232 ( a bill that raised taxes ) are two good examples that appear to suggest that the political success of the industrial business class is maintaining itself under the Lula government , " Mancuso says .

This so-and-so samba
Academic world tries to understand how a genre was transformed into the most important one of Brazilian music in the 20th century
Gonçalo Junior
They announced and warranted that samba was going to end .
That was what Assis Valente ( 1911-1958 ) used to say , in a modern parody of his famous composition about the end of the world , sung by Carmen Miranda back in the 1930s .
They even said that the genre had been killed by the bossa nova , and , later on , by tropicalism .
Decades afterwards , in the 1990s , the executioner was said to be the romantic studio ' pagode ( less traditional samba ) ' done with synthesizers .
Although it has faced the competition of several crazes in the last twenty years and appears little in the media today , samba is the most popular and long-lasting Brazilian musical rhythm of the 20th century , besides being one of the most remarkable cultural manifestations of the country -- indissociable from Carnival .
Just like jazz and blues in America , samba traversed a century with mutations , fusions , adhesions and experiments .
A rhythm that rekindles itself every year in the merrymaking of carnival and in the disks of its most vigorous representatives today : Paulinho da Viola , Zeca Pagodinho , Dudu Nobre or Luis Carlos da Vila , amongst others .
How to explain so many announced deaths and rebirths and understanding such popularity that it still enjoys ?
Or why samba imposed itself , in the primordial days of the phonographic and radioindustry , or was adopted by Getúlio Vargas to establish a cultural identity ?
These and other themes are discussed in three doctoral theses of the most important , because they help to redimension the historical and cultural role of samba .
The odd thing is that the authors are all citizens of São Paulo , a fact that seems to have helped to provide a useful distancing for coincidentally complementary and revealing readings to be made of a music so marked for being ' carioca ( from Rio de Janeiro ) ' , although it came from Bahia and has installed itself in São Paulo as well .
In Abençoado e danado do samba [ Blessed so-and-so samba ] , Ricardo José Duff Azevedo resorted to an extensive collection of 7 thousand sambas to show values of the Brazilian oral tradition .
He explains why songs of the genre are part of the popular imagery .
Presented to the Postgraduate Program in Literary Theory and Compared Literature of USP 's College of Philosophy , Literature and Human Sciences ( FFLCH ) , the dissertation set off from the principle that samba lyrics represent an extraordinary collection of something that could be called " popular discourse . "
Azevedo points out that popular cultures and their manifestations tend to evolve by means of " long duration patterns . "
The phenomenon is opposite to the modern , mass and erudite cultures , which follow " short duration patterns " -- almost mechanically in search of the " new , " of the " new form " etc .
Accordingly , in sambas , for being connected with long duration processes , the procedures with language and many themes are recurrent throughout the whole of the 20th century until today .
Some of them are the family , work , parties , growing old , death , religiosity , the " us , " amongst other subjects linked to concrete day to day life .
Rascal -- Azevedo 's lengthy thesis-- still without an editor -- brings together about 500 samba lyrics , gathered from a universe of over 7 thousand pieces of music , of which he did a pre-selection of 4.8 thousand .
Instead of snipping out historical periods , he tried to demonstrate recurrences in a broad spectrum , which made possible another comprehension of the importance of samba .
The author regards as a mistake , for example , the fact that many studies locate the " bad guy " in the 1930s and 1940s and talk of his " disappearance . "
What may have disappeared , he explains , is a certain version of the rascal .
" Samba talks about rascality and has adopted a ' rascally tone ' since the first recorded samba until now .
In actual fact , the bad guy never existed in a more cultured discourse , also present in the lyrics of Brazilian popular music .
At the same time that popular cultures are usually solemnly despised by the cultural elites , they have marked and been sources for a significant part of Brazilian erudite culture , through every kind of appropriation .
" I defend the idea that samba lyrics can only be understood and evaluated when seen as an expression of a certain model of conscience .
In the ambit of Brazilian popular music , I see tropicalism as the best finished and clear representation of a model I called ' official ' . "
The author used several tropicalist lyrics in a comparative way to highlight the characteristics of samba lyrics .
While the tropicalist compositions tend to presuppose a reading , rereading and interpretation of the reality seen by their authors , samba lyrics are usually created for sharing , immediate communication and memorization , always by means of broad themes , capable of generating great identification amongst people .
Hence its popularity and massification .
Following this logic , it is a production for which the music invites the community to take part , " since its function as a spectator is not to accept its work passively , but to repeat it once again for itself . "
In the case of tropicalism , for example , these themes tend to disappear from the schooled and official discourse , which opted for more specific themes , in a way that was often distanced , analytic and impersonal , as if it were proposing a " theory . "
" I do not intend to criticize tropicalism , to say that samba is better or worse , but rather to stress that the lyrics of tropicalism were created from a constructive model with ethical and esthetic standards different from those used by the majority of samba composers , whether they are literate or not . "
Industry -- Samba more and more ceased to be , in the first decades of the 20th century , a traditional music , to become a product of the so-called entertainment industry .
The possibility of professionalizing popular music , the arrival of commercial radio -- in search of novelties -- and the nationalist project of the Getúlio Vargas government showed the involvement of a good part of Brazilian society in the creation of the " national samba , " a mixture of tradition and modernity .
This is the essence of the thesis by José Adriano Fenerick , Nem do morro , nem da cidade : as transformações do samba e a indústria cultural - 1920-1945 [ Neither from the hill , nor from the city : the transformations of samba and the cultural industry -- 1920-1945 ] -- also defended at USP 's FFLCH .
Fenerick saw in the modernization of Rio de Janeiro in the early days of last century , in tune with the emergence of new means of communication , a propitious scenario for samba to undergo countless transformations .
Accordingly , from the 1920s , with the dissemination of the phonographic industry , the rhythm began to transform and modernize itself .
It ceased to be just a party held in houses of sorceresses , to gain other meanings .
At a first moment , it became a musical genre , identified with the black population of Rio de Janeiro .
Soon afterwards , it became a mixture of music and dance , identified with Brazil .
" Samba turned carioca and took the lead for the fact that Rio was thought of , those days , as a sort of ' picture postcard ' of the country , " the researcher explains .
The recording industry had a great influence on the emergence of this new kind of music , which Fenerick calls " modern samba . "
'Samba-pagode ' , practiced as ' partido-alto ' , which used to be made up of improvisations following a theme , could last a whole day .
With its recording on a disk , there could no longer be improvisation , in the lyrics at least , since a definitive version was established , registered in acetate , and which came to be disseminated by society as well , through the radio , to the whole country .
Furthermore , the samba composer gained the status of a professional musician , particularly the singers , since the composers had countless problems to establish themselves .
In this aspect , one of the topics dealt with by Fenerick was the still little investigated sale of sambas -- almost always addressed as folklore by biographers and historians of popular music .
" The need to show music in a meager market created the ' jabá ' ( the practice of paying a radio for airing a song ) , or , worse still , the ' purchase and sale ' of samba . "
The sociological aspect of samba was also investigated .
If in the popular imagination there remained the recollection of Francisco Alves and Carmen Miranda , amongst others , that of the hill was associated with something bad -- represented as the place of blacks , rascals , loafing and violence .
All in a very pejorative way .
This image was to perpetuate itself since the end of slavery at least .
he radio was seen by the government , and by a good part of the intellectuals , as a " noble " means of " educating the people . "
According to the researcher , the discourse was potentialized , emphasizing the ideological profile that the intellectuals , and even the Vargas government , wanted to accomplish .
Not by chance , the invention of samba-exaltation came from this period , the greatest symbol of which was Aquarela do Brasil , by Ary Barroso ( 1903-1964 ) .
A mythology was created that " pure samba " came from the slums of the city of Rio de Janeiro , but Fenerick concluded that both samba from the slums and samba from the middle class were , and still are , interlinked .
" The samba musician on the radio would go to the slum to buy a samba to record , in the same way that the samba musician from the school would go down to the city to parade in Carnival . "
Varguism -- The political aspect highlighted by Fenerick appears in a more in-depth way in the study by musician and historian Magno Bissoli , the author of Caixa preta : samba e identidade nacional na era Vargas -- impacto do samba na formação da identidade na sociedade industrial : 1916-1945 [ Black box : samba and national identity in the Vargas era -- impact of samba on the formation of identity in the industrial society : 1916-1945 ] , another thesis defended at USP 's FFLCH .
Bissoli claims that Getúlio Vargas , while he was in power , hitched a ride on the popular acceptance of this musical genre and gave a considerable impulse to its dissemination and affirmation as an icon of the country .
" The process of popularizing samba was imminent , but certainly Vargas 's policy contributed towards its consolidation in the national panorama , " he explains .
Like the fascist doctrines of Europe , the post-1930 government was always characterized by its exaltation of nationalism .
But how to disseminate , the researcher asks , a national identity in a Brazil with only four centuries of history and where the major part of the population was made up of descendents of slaves and marginalized persons , particularly blacks and half-breeds ?
Varguism then tried to forge it on the foundations of culture , by resorting to artifices similar to those used by Benito Mussolini in Italy .
Its methods ranged from the projection of films on the walls of houses and the installation of loudspeakers in squares in the interior and in shantytowns to the nationalization of vehicles of communication and censorship of the press .
The New State , set off by a coup in 1937 , invested in this proposition by controlling culture and media .
In actual fact , back in 1931 , President Vargas created the Official Propaganda Department , which was later to be transformed into the Press and Propaganda Department ( DIP ) , in 1939 , which became responsible for the censorship of the press and the jingoistic propaganda of the dictatorship .
With its growing and promising power of influence , radio became fundamental in this process .
In 1940 , Nacional radio passed to state control and started presenting music programs with a popular content .
One highlight in this wave of jingoism that took hold of the country was the composer and broadcaster Henrique Foréis Domingues ( 1908-1980 ) , the Admiral .
Known as the " highest rank in Brazilian radio , " he became " an important figure for the propagation , by radio , of the idea of a nationality . "
In the same period , the Brazilian Orchestra was created , with maestro Radamés Gnattali ( 1906-1988 ) , who , on the wave of nationalism , would interpret Brazilian music with the same treatment afforded foreign music .
In those days , Bissoli reports , various compositions arose , some from famous samba composers who supported Vargas and the New State .
Names like Ataulfo Alves , João de Barro ( Braguinha ) and Moreira da Silva composed and interpreted some of these compositions , in a clear example that samba was more and more reaching the great masses .
Another point raised by the research was the one that , to be accepted by society , particularly by the elite , samba had to " whiten " -- by being adopted by white singers and composers .
Like Noel Rosa , whose work left the certainty that samba would never die .
More than that , it would be eternal .

Devastating bacteria
The curriculum of the genreXanthomonas is not something modest .
Not so much for the number of species , only 20 , but for its range : it attacks 392 plants , with specific varieties of beans , rice , manioc , cotton , corn , sugar cane , wheat and Soya bean , as examples .
It was he who provided the samples ofX .
citri to be sequenced .
" In cold climates theXanthomonas almost don 't appear . "
Whilst theXylella is a problem restricted principally to Brazil and the Argentine , the bacteria of the other genres destroy plants in Asia , in Africa and in North America .
In Brazil , it is found from the States of Rio Grande do Sul to Rio Grande do Norte .
Citric cancer is only one of the diseases caused by theXanthomonas .
Described for the first time in 1889 in Japan , it is actually endemic in all of South East Asia .
It arrived in Brazil in 1957 and since then has only advanced .
According to him , because of this pest , the Argentine no longer cultivates these varieties and at the moment it is the growers in Florida , in the United States , who are losing their sleep , preoccupied by the same possibility .
The citric cancer is associated with the burrowing larva of the citrus ( Phyllocnistis citrella ) , detected in Brazil in 1996 .
The larva makes passageways in the leaves through which theXanthomonas enter .
Proliferating , they make salient lesions on the leaves and fruit which ends up falling off .
To avoid the spread of the pest , there is no other way : it is necessary to remove the contaminated trees .
In 1999 , the State of São Paulo eliminated close to 1 million trees .
The bill to be paid is also high : during the last two years , the control and the eradication cost close to R $ 50 million .
" The combat of citric cancer improved considerably . "
he stated " If it continues in this manner , we might be able to keep the situation under control . "

An advance against malaria
Attack of the erythrocyte protozoan parasite is related to the level of melatonin
To develop new chemotherapeutics , it is essential to understand the mechanisms which regulate the cycle of life of the protozoa .
Recently , the research of a team from the Department of Physiology of the Institute of Biosciences ( IB ) of the University of S ? o Paulo ( USP ) found a solid clue to these mechanisms .
By studying the cells of mice and of humans infected with the protozoan parasite , the team - coordinated by the biochemist Celia Garcia , with the collaboration of the pharmacologist Regina Markus - showed that the hormone melatonin contained in the host , appears to be responsible for the fine synchrony of the life cycle of the parasite within the organism .
A frightening synchrony
The work , which was the headline in a special publication of the English magazineNature , was developed during the thematic projectCellular and Molecular Biology of Plasmodium : Comparative Aspects of the Study of Transduction Indication in the Relationship Parasite-Host , financed by FAPESP .
This unicellular organism of the genreplasmodium houses itself in the salivary glands of the mosquitoAnopheles and penetrates into the organism through the bite of the insect .
Within the host - as well as man , the parasite infects other mammals , birds and amphibians - , the protozoan parasite makes its way to the cells of the liver and afterwards to the erythrocytes - the red globules of blood .
In fact , it is in the erythrocytes that the protozoa reveals a peculiarity of its lifecycle which makes the control of the infection very difficult .
Obeying a frightening synchrony , the parasites , practically all of them at the same time , mature and multiply , attack and breakdown the infected cellular membrane , opening the way to simultaneously enter the blood stream and toinvade cells which are still healthy .
What was needed was to disclose the mechanism which governs the orchestrated advance of the parasites , to arrive at a discovery which would help in the development of more efficient medicines against malaria an illness which each year kills 1 million people in the world .
It is here that we put in the good news from the research team .
By way of studies with the cells of mice and of humans infected with the protozoan parasite , the team made clear the relationship between the quantity of the hormone melatonin present in the cells and the synchrony verified in all the phases of the life cycle of the parasite .
Counter attack
Melatonin is a hormone produced during the night by the pineal gland , in a daily cycle - repeated every 24 hours .
It is already known that this hormone synchronizes various functions of the immunological system , nerves and endocrine .
More was discovered : " Bothin vitro andin vivo , the melatonin is capable of modifying the cycle of the parasite .
We took a step to reveal the regulation of the synchronism of the protozoan parasite in the cells of the host .
reassured Dr. Celia , a graduate in chemistry from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) , where she did her masters and doctorate .
Her research found its way onto the pages of the July edition ofNature Cell Biology , one of the publications of the renowned English scientific magazineNature .
The team also revealed that the synchrony of the attack of the protozoan can be broken if the rhythm of the production of melatonin was to be altered - which , in theory , leaves the infection more vulnerable and easier to be overcome .
When in mice the secretion of this hormone was impeded - by way of the removal of the pineal gland - or there was administered to them drugs which impede the protozoan from detecting the presence of melatonin , the life cycle of the protozoan was totally altered .
Biochemical action
In general lines , one can say that the increase in the concentration of melatonin in the host allows the protozoa parasites which invade red blood cells to evolve simultaneously from their initial stages , called ring and trophozont , for the more mature stage of schizont .
At the end of this stage , after they have reproduces asexually , the parasites break down the host cell , enter into the blood stream and reinitiate the process of the infection .
When they pass from the stage of trophozont for that of schizont each parasite generates between 18 and 35 new protozoan parasites inside the invaded red blood cell - an army which is put in charge of destroying it .
Using fluorescent indicators which permit the quantification of the calcium ion , the team showed that the melatonin is capable of causing the liberation of calcium contained in the intercellular deposits of the protozoa .
Thecalcium is extremely important , as it determines various processes , especially cell division .
Consequently , with the melatonin of the host active to the liberation of calcium within the cell of the parasite , this calcium could activate the process which provokes the maturation and the cellular multiplication of the protozoan parasite itself .
To arrive at these conditions , the researchers carried out live experiments with mice and in test tubes with cell cultures of rats and of humans .
Firstly , they added melatonin to a culture of cells of mice of the species called Balb / C infected withPlasmodium chabaudi - the protozoan malaria which infects this animal .
Seventeen hours later , they verified that there had been an increase in the number of red blood cells invaded by parasites , proportional to the quantity of the hormone injected .
The result indicated that the melatonin accelerates the reproduction of the parasite .
Acceleration
In order to prove that the melatonin really accelerates the infection , the team carried out similar experiments with a culture of human cells .
Contaminated withPlasmodium falciparum - the species of parasite of malaria which most commonly attacks man - , this culture also received gradual doses of melatonin .
In parallel , they kept as a control group , a culture of human red blood cells contaminated with the same species of the protozoan parasite , but not submitted to doses of melatonin .
The result was exactly as expected : 24 hours after the start of the treatment with melatonin , the red blood cells infected withPlasmodium falciparum had a much higher quantity of parasites in the final stage of schozont than that of the control group - proof that the melatonin had accelerated the development of the parasite in the red blood cells .
Or that is to say , this species of parasite needs two days to pass through the three phases - develop , mature and multiply - before it breaks down the invaded red blood cell and is ready to attack new cells .
" The life cycle of all the protozoan parasites is always a multiple of 24 hours . "
After having put together evidence that the hormone melatonin dictated the rhythm of the maturing of the parasite in cultures within the laboratory , the researchers began live experiments with mice .
The objective was to determine of the absence of the production of melatonin by the host or the perception of it by the parasite would also have some effect on the life cycle of the development of malaria .
Therefore , they removed the pineal gland -which stopped the complete production of the hormone - from the mice of species Balb / C and infected them with a population ofPlasmodium chabaudi , whose life cycle in the host is 24 hours .
Seventy two hours after the start of the infection , the quantity of parasites in the initial ring stage was twice as high in the mice which had not produced melatonin than of the control group which had remained with the pineal gland .
Also , it was revealed that the quantity of parasites in the phase of trophozont was a lot less in the animals incapable ofsecreting the hormone than in the control group .
That is to say , without the melatonin of the host , the life cycle of the parasite lost its synchrony .
They carried out another study in which they changed the focus - from the host to the parasite .
Working with two types of mice , Balb / C and C3H , they injected them with the drug luzindole - an inhibitor of the receptors of melatonin - and , at the same time , infected them withPlasmodium chabaudi .In a general manner , the inhibitor reduces the capacity of the parasite to identify the melatonin of the host and to react to it , which alters all of the chemical process which gives it its changes of phase and its cell divisions .
In this situation , the host continues producing normally the melatonin , but the parasite isn 't completely able to perceive this .
Motive : half of the close to 170 species of protozoan parasites in existence infect lizards , which , strangely enough , have a very low indices of mortality due to this infection .
Why do the lizards resist so well the protozoan parasite ?
The researchers are looking for an answer by studying the life cycle of the parasites within the organism of these reptiles .
This could point in some direction in the sense of avoiding the deadliness of malaria in other species , above all in humans .
There are two species of lizards of the Amazon which are under study in the laboratories of Biosciences of USP , theAmeiva and theTupinambis meriane .

The scourge of the tropics
Malaria causes high fever over regular intervals - more or less every 24 hours , the moment at which the parasites break down the infected red blood cells and again reach the blood stream in order to invade more red blood cells .
Other symptoms are vomiting headaches and pains in the joints .
The more serious cases evolve into a state of coma and death .
There are no vaccines approved by the scientific community - some are under test - however , though sometimes it resists medicines , the infection can be weakened if it is treated rapidly and adequately .
Nevertheless , the numbers go on impressing .
The scourge of malaria kills each year between two and three million people in the whole world , above all the young - it is estimated that a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds , almost three thousand per day .
Maintaining the vicious circle , the transmitter mosquitoAnopheles bites between 300 and 500 million people per year and into them injects the protozoan parasite which unleashes the illness in new victims .
Of every ten cases , nine occur in the portion of Africa below the Sahara .
Of the remainder , six countries concentrate two thirds - among them is Brazil .
It is calculated that close to 40 % of the population of the world live in areas with a risk of transmission .
For the World Health Organization , malaria is the most serious tropical illness caused by a parasite .
The latest results
Called by many as " the Queen of the diseases " because of these high indices of incidence and mortality , it continues to challenge the world .
To combat it in Brazil , close to 300 specialists participated from the 26th until the 29th of November in Rio de Janeiro , at the 7th National Meeting of Malaria Research .
The meeting - which had the support of FAPESP in financing the travelling expenses of the researchers - brought the latest results in the areas of vaccines , diagnosis , transmission control and National data .
The principal theme was the intensification of the disease in the Amazon , above all in the areas of the mining camps and settlements .
The tendency of the growth is worrying : according to the National Health Foundation , there were 405,000 cases in 1997 and a record 632,000 in 1999 - 34 % more than in the previous year .
In this last year , 99 % of the cases were in the Amazon .
The migration of part of the population from rural zones to the cities has also worsened the situation .
A group from the Federal University of S ? o Paulo ( Unifesp ) , coordinated by the immunologist Mauricio Rodrigues , is studying the immunizing action of the protein MSP 1 ofPlasmodium vivax , the most common species of the parasite which causes malaria in the country .
In tests with guinea pigs this protein was capable of stimulating an immunological response of up to 90 % among the guinea pigs infected .
In 2001 tests of the protein will begin in saimiris monkeys at the National center of Primates of Belem .
" Let 's check out the immunological response of these monkeys , in which we could reproduce the malaria caused by the vivax , since they are animals closely related to man . " he explained .
A trangenic mosquito
The development of a mosquito which would be resistant to the infections of parasites is another alternative .
The insect physiologist Dr. Margareth Capurro , of Unifesp , explained that the objective of the research is the introduction into the mosquito which is the transmitter of malaria , theAnopheles , of a gene which interferes with the development of the parasite .
In this way , the mosquito will become a poor transmitter of malaria or stop transmitting it at all , breaking the cycle of the disease .
She highlighted some challenges in order to arrive at the transgenic mosquito : to liberate this mosquito into the wild with an assurance that it will become dominant , in a way that it will pass its new genes to the wild population ofAnopheles .
Dr. Denise Vale , of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation , is also studying the blocking of the parasite in the digestive tube of the mosquito .
Edmund Christian , of the Pan-American Health Organization ( Opas ) , remembered that the walls of the mud brick houses and brickwork of the endemic regions of the disease absorb many times the insecticides used in the control of the mosquito , reducing its efficiency .
He believes that " it is necessary to test other frameworks for distributing the insecticides to increase their efficiency . "
He also cited alternative methods of prevention such as a soap with repellant compounds to the malaria transmitter which is being tested in Colombia and in Venezuela .
As far as the diagnostic methods are concerned , Dr. Cor Jesus Fontes , of the Federal University of Mato Grosso , believes that it is necessary to perfect diagnostic kits which are more modern and cheaper .
He analyzed blood samples from 630 people of Mato Grosso and discovered that the actual methods have a detection rate of 80 % for thePlasmodium falciparum - for the species linked to the highest number of serious cases and those causing mortality - , an indices considered insufficient .
Plan of attack
In spite of everything , the deadliness of the disease in Brazil has gone down a lot : according to the National Health Foundation , close to 150 people died from malaria during 1998 , five times less than at the beginning of the 90s .
At the national reunion it was estimated that the increase in the incidences could be reverted as from 2001 with the implementation of the Plan of Intensification of the Control of Malaria .
The training of personnel and the acquisition of microscopes for the diagnosis are among the strategies of the plan which will invest R $ 145 million over the next few years to reduce by 50 % the incidence of malaria in the Amazon .

A complete radiography pertaining to the city of São Paulo
Over the last five decades , the municipality of São Paulo has been continually water-proofed by cement and asphalt , in an uncontrolled occupation which has expanded , without planning , to the periphery , destroying the native vegetation and the green areas which it met as it went along .
Only during the last 13 years , the capital city has lost 30 % of its vegetation cover , the temperature has risen and consequently the quality of life has worsened .
This is what is shown by the first data of the projectEnvironment Atlas of the Municipality of São Paulo , which will be available on CD-ROM and on the Internet by the end of December .
The project of the atlas had the financial support of FAPESP to the tune of R $ 149,000 and the collaboration of professors of the University of S ? o Paulo ( USP ) and of the Botanical Institute of the Secretary of the Environment of the State .
Developed to last five years , from 1999 until 2003 , by 25 technicians of the municipal secretaries of Greenery and the Environment ( SVMA ) and of Planning , it is integrated into Biota / FAPESP - the Research Program into Sustainable Conservation of the Biodiversity of the State of São Paulo .
A late diagnosis
Enlisted into a project to reunite , analyze and interpret maps , cadasters , censuses , tables , reports and information obtained on site - by satellite images , aerial photos and field studies - , the team has been elaborating a diagnosis of the vegetation cover of the municipality .
This in-depth registry comes associated with socio economic aspects of the use and occupation of the land , as well as the characteristics of the physical topography and the detailing of the areas of greatest interest .
Professor Mantovani understands , for example , that it is necessary to increase the number of species adopted within the planted trees of the city in order to obtain a diversity in the flowering and thus permit an increase in the fauna .
He gave as an example : " On the city USP campus , by way of the vegetation , we have brought back birds such as the thrush , tucan , parakeet , and parrot , species which had disappeared . "
For the children
As well as the images of the satellite and of the photos taken by helicopter , photos of various locations were taken from the division with Peruibe until the high Cantareira and from the end of the East zone until the peak of Jaragua in the extreme west .
" We have details of these areas and are putting on the Internet descriptions of them .
We are also putting them on a CD-ROM for the schools with the objective that the children have a better understanding of their city . "
For him , the municipal schools need to teach about the environment : The diagnosis is not only biological , but social as well , and the preservation of the vegetation is related to investments in education , health , housing and the distribution of income . "
The agronomy engineer Luis Roberto Jacintho of SVMA , who is participating in the project , said that the objective of the vegetation mapping is to identify the poorest areas so as to orientate the interference by public authority .
" We are going to look to characterize the types of vegetation which exist in the municipality - as well as the lack of green areas in the urban and rural ambience - and to establish what can be done so as not to lose them . "
Lost greenery
Before beginning the research , the researchers already knew that , of the 1512 square kilometers of the largest Brazilian metropolis , only 247.4 were still occupied by green areas - of which 154.8 are in the urban zones according to a survey carried out in 1992 by the Secretary of Planning of the City Hall .
Now , the comparative analysis of the images of the satellites show that the green areas have decreased throughout the municipality .
The loss was more accentuated in the districts on the periphery , in the East zone and especially in two vital areas : the high hills of the Cantareira and the hinterland of the Guarapiranga reservoir .
The engineer Jacintho remembers that the few remaining green areas are degraded and need to be preserved .
" In a comparison of the satellite images of 1986 with those of 1999 , we have already confirmed that there has been a loss of vegetation in terms of 30 % .
However , these are preliminary details : we are carrying out a check on the quantification which could increase or decrease the percentage of the loss . "
Internal migration
The researchers and technicians want to know exactly which of the areas have lost most vegetation cover and which of them have had the least loses or which will eventually make a gain .
Normally , when an allotment is approved , it is obligatory to preserve a part as a green area .
In the cases of the irregular allotments , however , as well as occupying green areas , they do not reserve any space for vegetation .
In search of green
The geologist cited the actions of other Brazilian cities which confronted the problems of the loss of the vegetation cover : " Rio de Janeiro , Belo Horizonte , Curitiba and Vitoria also brought together well organized ambiental information , but the only ambiental atlas which has been concluded and edited into a book and put on CD-ROM is that of Porto Alegre , published in 1998 . "
As well as this work of the Gaucho capital city , the Pualista project was inspired by a German example : the Atlas of Berlin of 1995 .
The Atlas will group together data dispersed through various municipal secretaries , give them a brushing up and will group them into maps which will make up a system of ambiental information as stipulated in the Organic Law of the municipality .
In this first phase the standards of the existing vegetation in the municipality will be checked out .
" For example , in the extreme south , " said engineer Jacintho , " in the division with Itanhaem , there is the typical vegetation of misty forest ( constant mist coverage ) and native forest , with endemic species ( exclusive to the place ) and which includes an area under environmental protection .
Also , we know that we have to protect the Cantareira , in the Northern zone , where there is a vegetation which is being lost . "
Appreciation of the native forest
" In the next step , " added professor Mantovani " we shall study the significance of these examples in detail , to determine which species exist in the natural forest and to characterize in minute detail the park areas . "
Once the green areas have been set out , the researchers and technicians will draw up proposals of plans to preserve the vegetation and to create new green areas , since the pressures for occupation are extremely high .
For Mantovani , one of the major problems is the occupation around the Guarapiranga reservoir and the degradation of its original vegetation .
" City Hall does not have a single project for the preservation and the re-introduction of native species . "
The others are exotic - coming from different countries - and the nearest of them is the tipuana tree which comes from the north of the Argentine .
Already on the Internet
There are various types of maps on the vegetation , climate and temperature , occupation and use of the land , socio economic information ( with maps of income , birth rate , and death rate , population concentration and the shanty town population per district ) , of drainage and sewage , geological and geotechnical .
These are data which could help even to combat floods , in the prevention of landslides and in the implantation of roads and avenues .
As well as the CD-ROM , there will be edited maps on a regional scale of 1 : 50.000 ,
For this , as well as the financial support of FAPESP , the project had the support of SVMA , which invested R $ 100,000.00 in the first phase of the Atlas .
Integrated with Sinbiota
" One of the basic premises of Biota , " he emphasized " is to appreciate all the information produced in the width of the program , since the most important is the integration of this information into the Sinbiota , the System of Ambiental Information of the Biota Program . "
The feeding of the data banks of Sinbiota will be on line , the same as the other projects .
Joly concluded : " The level of the loss of vegetation of the municipality of S ? o Paulo is alarming and clearly shows that , as well as the quantitative and qualitative diagnoses of the remaining vegetation , the Atlas Project will have to define an agenda of actions which will revert this picture .
That is to say , it will be necessary to establish a program of recovery of the native vegetation . "

Research which intervenes in the structure of the lowermost blocks of a material produces compounds such as a sensor for the conserving of wines
Marcos Pivetta
In the 21st century the world of science will become smaller , according to those who dedicate themselves to the emergent area of molecular nanotechnology .
The specialists in this branch of nanosciences propose that they can dominate the manipulation of molecules and of the smallest particle of material capable of retaining the chemical characteristics of an element - the atom .
This is the proposal of Henrique Toma , of the Chemical Institute at the University of São Paulo ( IQ-USP ) .
In the projectDevelopment of Supermolecules and Molecular Arrangements , financed by FAPESP , Dr. Toma is dedicating himself to the creation in the laboratory of stable systems on the scale of a nanometer , what are being called supermolecules .
A nonometer is equal to 10-9 meters , a billionth part of a meter or a millionth part of a millimeter - in short , the space which can hold at the maximum ten atoms .
In the manipulation of the majority of the supermolecules to which the project refers , the objective is to reproduce in them some chemical reaction present inNature or in the human body such as photosynthesis - in which the plant uses light to convert water , carbon dioxide and minerals into oxygen and compounds rich in energy - or the products of the action of enzymes .
A Balanced wine
One of the compounds which he most uses are the porphyries , a type of pigment abundant inNature and which take part in various biological processes .
In man , for example , porphyries rich in iron are present in hemoglobin and are responsible for the transportation and the storage of oxygen in living tissues .
By way of the combination of two types of porphyries , Dr. Toma and his colleague at the Department of Fundamental Chemistry of IQ-USP , Dr. Koiti Araki , produced some interesting compounds .
One of them was a supermolecule which organized itself spontaneously , forming a photochemical film ( which reacts to light ) or as a catalyst ( capable of accelerating a chemical reaction ) .
Another compound forms a molecular film which functions as a sensor for sulfite - a discovery which is worth toasting .
Explanation : if explored commercially this sensor could be useful for wine producers .
The wineries use sulfite for conserving - an antioxidant , a substance capable of removing the air from the drink .
However , to avoid any danger to health , the quantity of sulfite should be constantly monitored .
In the prototype developed in collaboration with Lucio Angnes , of IQ-USP , the film of porphyries created to serve as a sensor is coated on a small tube linked to an electrode .
When the wine enters in contact with the sensor by flowing from the tube , the electrode indicates an electric current , by way of which , indirectly , the quantity of sulfite in the drink can be known - the greater the sulfite , the higher the electric current .
Dr. Toma cites two advantages of the sulfite sensor developed at USP in relation to the usual equipment : low cost and immediate measurement .
" in 30 seconds the result comes out . "
said Dr. Toma .
As well as this , the measurement is made in only a few milliliters of the drink , which avoids wastage .
Simple equipment
Not always does one need to revert to equipment of the latest generation to produce supermolecules .
In a general manner , the procedure followed in the immersion method can be summarized in the following manner .
Dr. Toma separated three recipients and filled the first with a solution of porphyries with a positive electric charge ( in fact , a molecule of porphyries linked to four molecules of ruthenium - a rare metal used to harden alloys of platinum and palladium ) .
The following step was to take a sheet of glass and to submerge it into the recipients in the order of one , two and then three .
The result : over the glass a film formed with two layers , the first with the positive porphyries and the second with the negative porphyries ( the water served only to remove the excess of the two compounds ) .
The immersion can be repeated various times amplifying the thickness of the resulting film - which is an example of a chemical supermolecule .
As can be seen in the structural representation of a new mounting of a supermolecule , the two original porphyries don 't mix .
The atoms of the negative solution fit themselves over the atoms of the positive solution , forming a new architectural molecule - a compound with properties totally different from the substances of its origin .
" The creation of this compound is the fruit of a process of molecular engineering .
affirmed Dr. Koiti Araki .
This single procedure hides a complicated reasoning for molecular architecture .
Before the experiment one needs to know how the atoms and molecules will rearrange themselves structurally at the end of the reaction and if the arrangement will be permanent or temporary .
This is something much more subtle and complex than simply imagining that the result of a reaction will be the sum of the atoms involved in the experiment .
The structure of the supermolecule , the form in which its atoms interlace and create a physical-chemical web which gives it origin , is as or is more important than its simple chemical formula .
Diamond and graphite
To compare diamond and graphite is a good example .
Both are minerals formed exclusively from atoms of carbon , only their structures are totally different .
Graphite has a layered structure of rings of six carbon atoms , arranged in horizontal layers distant from each other .
In diamond , each atom is linked to four other equidistant atoms , in a closed , dense and resistant 3-dimensional structure in the form of a tetrahedral or octahedral .
It is in fact this distinct internal structure which makes diamond a transparent material and with a hardness without equal inNature , whilst graphite is dark , soft and can be broken .
If one day the nanotechnicians have full control of the molecules , they could reorganize the atoms of graphite and transform them into diamond .
More than a century ago , man made use of the benefit of the nano world : the tire industry , for example , uses nanoparticles of carbon to re-inforce the rubber of its product .
" The nano world is here .
The basis of the modern notions of molecular nanotechnology , however , are more recent .
At the end of 1959 , at the annual meeting of the American Society of Physic , Richard P. Feynman gave a provocative speech which would enter into history as the initial kick .
Since then , we have been looking , more than using possible beneficial properties of nanoparticles , to act at the nano level : to manipulate atoms .
To construct , to re-construct , to perfect and to invest molecules .
At the moment , the new science holds many promises and modest practical results .
To accelerate the rhythm the Foresight Institute of Palo Alto , California , reverted to an old and efficient way of stimulating inventiveness : a large prize in money .
A prize for small things
To take home the large Feynman Prize - and US $ 250,000 - the researcher or group of researchers who will be the first to design and construct two appliances : a robotic arm which can be enclosed inside a cube of at the maximum 100 nanometers of dimension and which will be capable of manipulating atoms and molecules in larger structures , and a type of computer which can fit into a cube of up to 50 nanometers and can carry out the same functions as a calculator of 8 bits .
The challenge was launched in 1996 and continues valid .
It is admitted that the Foresight Institute will raise the prize toUS $ 1 million if it receives sufficient donations .
As yet far from producing an ingenious revolution as asked for , Dr. Toma can display a recognition : in 1996 he won the chemistry prize of the Third World Academy of Science , situated in Italy , for his studies on the development of supermolecules based on polymetallic complexes .
To advance more , Dr. Toma pretends to put in his laboratory a basic item of the nanoworld : an atomic force and tunneling microscope .
These two techniques of microscopy permit visualizing and interfering with each atom of a molecule , though yet in a precarious manner .
According to Dr. Toma , if the adepts of molecular nanotechnology were astronomers , the atomic force and tunneling microscope would be his more powerful telescope .

Admirable new nanoworld
Many things will change if the scientists and technicians of nanoscience manage to produce their gadgets .
There is no lack of theoretical examples .
Nanocompounds taken in by a human being would look after the maintaining of a healthy organism , unblocking arteries and combating infectious agents .
Nanorobots would produce fuel at low cost , without offending the environment or consuming its resources .
Nanotubes of carbon would take the place of transistors and substitute silicon in the manufacture of powerful nanochips .
The supreme invention would be a factory of molecular structures - a fitter of molecules capable of making any compound , even copies of itself .
A delirium according to the skeptics .
Even worse , say the apocalyptics : if we were to completely dominate the atoms , man could provoke the destruction of himself and even of the planet .
In truth , the clear domination of the universe of the molecule is still a long way off .
Zyvex , one of the new companies working in this field in California , calculates that in five or ten years there will be some invention on the market , but they don 't know what .
After all , they argue , in 2005 or 2010 people will have different necessities than those of today .

Brazil invites interested parties
To judge by the investments that the developed countries are beginning to make in the area , the science of the small has already turned into a filed of billionaire research .
In October last , the Congress of the United States approved an annual budget of almost US $ 500 million which the Government will requisition top launch its National Program of Nanotechnology .
In 2001 , Japan itself pretends to spend US $ 400 million on nanoscience , 41 % more than in 2000 .
The Europeans maintain isolated and group initiatives , also pushed forward by large investments .
And Brazil ?
Until now , there have been isolated initiatives in S ? o Paulo and other States , with work which could be covered within a wide national incentive .
The country still does not have a national program of nanoscience , but that appears to be for only a short time .
On the 22nd of November last , the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) called a meeting in Brasilia of those interested in participating in a possible national program of nanotechnology .
The wide world of nanoscience was divided into three thematic groups , as in the North American program : 1 ) nanoappliances , nanosensors , nanoelectronics ( semiconductors , magnetic materials , nanotubes , optoelectronics , photonics ) ; 2 ) nanostructured materials ; 3 ) nanobiotechnology / nanochemistry .
" We are attempting to detect the needy areas of national science .
We know that nanotechnology is an emerging sector and very important .
Through this meeting , we could feel the interest of the scientific community .
The electronic address of the commission is : nano @ cnpq.br is receiving e-mails of those interested .

The ecologist Waldir Mantovani , collaborator with the project , explained the diversities of the occupations within the city limits .
" There is an area of high density : they are buildings constructed during the last fifty years in the old city center , on the axle which runs from Avenida Paulista until Santo Amaro , in districts such as Santana , Penha and Tatuape and in others near to the metro stations , such as Jabaquara .
In these locations , the satellite images show a lot of dark patches and hide the vegetation . "
However , on the periphery , he explained , there is as the norm a high density of houses constructed on small land plots with no backyard or garden , on narrow roads without any trees .
" It is cement on top of cement , without any cover of vegetation . "
This situation in which is found the major extension of the urban area , including the favelas ( shanty towns ) with houses made of brickwork and without street planning .
Another type of horizontal occupation , which can be looked at in a more or less sparse manner as far as trees and gardens are concerned , occurs in districts which were the periphery 40 years ago , such as Bras , Ipiranga , Sacome , Vila Prudente , Penha , part of Lapa , Vila Leopoldina and Santo Amaro .
In the districts of the Jardins , Higienopolis , Alto de Pinheiros , Alto da Lapa , Jardim America , Pacaembu , in the area close to Ibirapuera Park , in Morumbi and in the Cantareira , " where the planning was made for a type of diffused arborization , with large trees and central passageways on the roads , the plots of the houses are larger and have ample sized gardens with large quantities of plants . "
Other sparse vegetation zones exist and are in areas of industry , schools , hospitals , squares , lakes and a few parks such as that of the State park , Morumbi park and Ibirapuera park .
" They are green areas which were planted or are maintained as remainders of native vegetation . "
Cantareira threatened
In the rural zone , the vegetation cover is more intense , above all in the State Park of the Serra da Cantareira - the major green area of the municipality - , where there has been an increasing urban growth , often irregular , as highlighted professor Mantovani .
" Then in the Southern zone , around the Guarapiranga reservoir , there are small farms in horticultural production , horse ranching , some eucalyptus plantations , and at the division with Peruibe , preserved spaces of natural forest . "
He revealed even more that " one of the types of vegetation which gives more density to the vegetation cover of the municipality are the reforestation of the Southern zone and also of the West , in the approaches to the motorways Anhanguera and Bandeirantes . "
However , it is the region of the Serra do Mar which display the strips of native vegetation most well preserved , " with species of Atlantic tropical forest , natural country and mist covered Atlantic tropical forest . "
Also , on the part closest to the high coastline ridge , there exist groves of lowland forest alternating with highland forest .

Flags of different colors , but nevertheless with the same ideal
A study compares the left-wing movements in Brazil and Italy during the post-war period
Marx arrived in Brazil by crossing the seas , but the founders of socialism , around here , came by ship .
The Italian immigrants were those responsible for the attempts to " give a conscience to the proletariat " and for the first strikes .
This close relationship between Italian-Brazilian militants in São Paulo at the beginning of the century , finished up being frozen in time .
Around 1930 , when the phase of mass immigration by foreigners was terminated , in spite of the massive presence of Italians here , there was no attempt whatsoever to form left-wing parties with collaboration between the leaders of the two countries .
It is this historical peculiarity which Alexandre Hecker presents in his studyThe Force of the Model : A Comparative History of Socialism in Brazil and Italy .
In the project , which has the support of FAPESP , he analyses the history of the left wings in Brazil and Italy during the period contained between post World War II and the 60s .
This is an account of " the politician " and not of " political policies . "
" The intention was not to produce a history of the institutions , only of the political parties and the workers ' unions .
Professor Hecker had already investigated in the thesis for his doctorate - which transformed itself into the bookSociable Socialism : History of the Democratic Left in São Paulo ( 1945-1965 ) ( Ed .
Unesp ) - the history of the left wing in São Paulo , but felt the necessity of filling in an omission in the Brazilian bibliography and to advance in the comparison of the party and ideological regimes .
" It reaches the point of being impressive , but no work of comparative history with similar characteristics has been realized without shortcomings on the Brazilian left wing . "
To compose the work , as well as the experience and the dialogue of the Brazilian militants , and of the intellectuals of São Paulo , such as Antonio Candido , Jacob Gorender , among others , professor Hecker spent six months in Italy .
His stay at the University of Milan between 1997 and 1998 , made possible his contact with specialists in the history of the Italian post war left such as Alceo Riosa and Aldo Agosti .
Professor Hecker also participated in debates and researches in different centers of study such as the Giacomo Brodolini Foundation , the official organ of the Italian Government for the encouragement of studies and the divulging of themes relative to the history of the Italian workers movement , national and international , as well as the workers culture ; Giangiacomo Feltrinelli , a private foundation , but of public interest , which consists of one of the most relevant research centers of study and orientation relative to the history of socialism and of the Italian workers movement , national and international , among other document centers .
The result was the reunion of a considerable archive ( close to 200 titles ) , between books , newspapers , magazines , document films and Xeroxed copies .
Among the curiosities are unpublished texts and manifests of the epoch , iconography , charges and all the symbolic references of the years of militancy of the left .
He hopes very soon to have finished the cataloging and to make the work available to the Center of Documents and Memory ( Cedem ) of the faculty of Sciences and Letters of Unesp .
Professor Hecker also finished two books .
One of them , which deals with the theorizing about Comparative History , will have translations of unpublished texts in Portuguese , such as those of Marc Bloch .
This compiling will be done in partnership with the professor of the History of America of USP , professor Maria Ligia Coelho Prado .
The other work will be the result of comparative research between the left wing parties of Brazil and Italy .
Comparing histories
The principal difficulty of the work , according to professor Hecker , was to find a methodology of support .
Comparison is a common procedure which was always part of historical research - whether it be to make a profile of the political leaders of different epochs and places , or to date documents and to give them authenticity .
Nevertheless , the theorization as to the scientific method used is relatively recent .
It was only possible during this century due to the French movements , above all , by way of the writings of the historian Marc Bloch .
" I opted for that which professor Bloch calls synchronic comparisons , or that is , to research societies , or historical situations , submitted to the same factors or derivatives of a common origin and to point out in them the similarities and differences . "
The result , different from working with societies very distinct in time and space - for example , the method made use of by anthropology to approximate primitive societies to the actual - , and which a temporal affinity makes it easier to acknowledge that never seen .
It is the singular and the purpose , by definition , of history .
To study the formation of the political left wing parties in Brazil and in Italy in the period after World War II appears to be an objective of studyhighly incited .
" We are speaking about similar institutions in content and in political party disposition , but which did not have any contact in the slightest between them .
The interest was to recognize models of constructed questions by the societies to explain the same crises through which they lived . "
Left , turn
The starting point of the work was 1945 , the date of the creation of the Brazilian Socialist Party in São Paulo , and of the Italian Socialist Party , recreated in Rome , shortly after the war ended .
" They are parties which were born from the same Marxist platform , with the same political proposals , of the eagerness to represent the proletariat , but they didn 't have direct contact points .
The socialists here didn 't mix with the socialists there and vice versa .
There was no exchange of literature , probably because in Brazil more importance had always been given to the literary works linked to France and the United States . "
Italy arrived at the end of the Second Word War without national unity and under the shadow of fascism .
The atmosphere was one of the most favorable for the left .
The phases of the order of the left , such as " Land for all , " delighted the rural masses .
In this atmosphere , all the antifascists ( communists , socialists , Christian democrats and liberals ) began the " resistance fight . "
In 1946 , the fight for national unity revolved around the three parties of the masses which had been recently created : the Christian Democrats , the Italian Socialist Party of Proletariat Unity and the Italian Communist Party .
The parties won extreme force in the process of the consolidation of democracy , so much so that until today Italy is considered to be a " party-cracy . "
In spite of the absence of direct contacts between the political institutions of the two countries , they formed similar socialist cultures , submitted to the same demands of the crisis of the period .
There was no exchange of leaders , never mind of specific theories .
The Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci was only translated in Brazil during the 60s and became well known among the intellectuals in the decade of the 70s .
" His works were held back for a long time .
Even in Italy , he was placed in a provincial context during the 50s .
His texts remained hidden within the Italian Communist Party because they were critical of the Soviet Union 's regime and this was not of interest to the militants . "
From early times , the PCI defended with intensity the position that the international communist movement had to be multicentered , with each party following its pathway and adopting a certain independence in relation to Moscow .
Before that , much to the contrary , the great leader Palmiro Togliatti , and all the Italian communist structure , is extremely confluent to Moscow , it didn 't take a step without following in the footsteps of the USSR . "
In Brazil , the slogan of the hammer and the sickle was not followed to the letter .
'The socialism of São Paulo after 1945 is , different from communism , a movement against the USSR .
However , in Italy , until the final breakdown , if one picked up any Italian socialist newspapers , there was only the hammer and the sickle .
This is very curious .
There , these manifestations had their martyrs , and the idea that an intellectual who was born bourgeois , on adopting the cause of the working class , should convert himself , to the point of believing that one of the first socialists in the world was Christ .
On the other hand , the formation of the socialist in São Paulo is linked to the democratic pluralism of the intellectuals which formed it and to the idea of a popular democracy .
An economic miracle
The economy , in tatters in the 50s , passed through an uncommon acceleration which provoked alterations not only at the levels of urbanization , consumption and in health , but in significant areas of cultural activities , such as television and the cinema .
Both in Brazil and in Italy , they passed through an " economic miracle . "
" The effervescence of the consumption in Italy was demonstrated by the Lambreta scooter .
All of Italy hoped to reach the point of having a small Lambreta and to go on pick-nicks .
On the other hand , it is said that no other country in the world grew more than Brazil during the 50s .
At the time of JK , the country grew at the breath taking rate of between 7 % and 8 % of its GNP .
This capitalist " boom " was responsible for the left wings of Italy and Brazil searching for distinct pathways .
" In Italy , there was an alliance of socialists with more conservative groups such as the Christian Democrats , which led to a softening of the revolutionary effort and to becoming a candidate for power which finished up occurring in 1963 .
In Brazil , the communists and the socialists came close to power , during that same epoch , through Jango ( President João Goulart ) , but the outcome was totally different .
Whilst in Italy they approached a democracy each time more disseminated , in Brazil they plunged into a dictatorship with the left wing persecuted and exterminated .
A defeated ideology ?
After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism , many insisted in looking at history along one pathway and with only one hand .
Contradictorily to the witnesses of the death of socialism , the parties of the opposition have maintained their vigor in Italy , and , more recently , are emerging in Brazil .
In various Brazilian State capitals , the movement of the left has come out fortified from the municipal elections which took place this year and the parties are already preparing for an eventual arrival at power .
For professor Hecker , there is a trail to the left possible for the future , but , if it has references to the past , it should return to its new pathway .
" The PT has something of the old socialist party whose slogan was : ' Socialism and liberty . ' 
In an era when there was no liberty the left wing always tended to give value to the triad of the French revolution , equality , while the liberals emphasized liberty . "
he analyzed " Even then , their viability passes through the search for a new path . "
In Italy , the arrival of the socialist leaders had contradictory results such as that of Bettino Craxi .
It was a traumatic process for Italy , but left wing socialism survived .
Today there is D 'Alema , who is no longer a communist , because we must really place all of these conceptual words under the light of criticism . "
Even today , Italian politics depends on the parties , which have formed a true mosaic with more than 30 party symbols .
Italy , though its playing in a party cracy system , continues being a valid reference . "
If the diagnosis is that the parties , government and ideologists , need to be reinvented , will there still be space for utopia ?
" We should look for points of approximation between individualism and society , since there is enough space for both .
He observed that today , for example , it is much more difficult to be a dictator because the processes are much more visible ( look at the cases of General Pinochet and President Fujimori ) .
There is a democratization via communications such as the Internet , through the dissemination of TV and through cable TV .
In Eastern Europe it was the television which organized the people to bring down the governments which called themselves communists .
All of this can permit a certain universal citizenship , according to the researcher .
" Perhaps one might be able to substitute the old patriotism related to the nation for a patriotism linked and belonging to democracy . "
In today 's times , he said , it is not a chimera to conjecture about the possibility of the formation of a universal tribunal of human rights .
" Who knows if in the future it will not be necessary to say , " I 'm Brazilian " but I 'm from " a large worldwide Non Governmental Organization which is fighting in defense of democracy . "
Instead of pertaining to a country , we shall pertain to a State of International Rights with a membership card and all that goes with it . "
For all that , socialism is not a doctrine in extinction . " Until one encounters another vocabulary , socialism will continue to signify the search for a more just society and its possible discovery . "

The metaphors of Woody Woodpecker
Research analyzes the effects of the ideology of animated designs on children
Over the last 20 years the fonoaudiologist , pedagogue and psychologist Dr. Elza Dias Pacheco has dedicated herself to the study of those which normally leave parents and educators with their hair standing on end .
During the decade of the 80 's , having agreed to attend to children in her consultancy , in which she developed the activity of language therapy , Dr. Elza began to become occupied with the effect that the high number of hours in front of a television could have on the children at the age of basic learning and alphabetization .
That is to say , those between the ages of 5 and 11 years .
Dr. Elza 's preoccupation , at that time , resulted in her doctorate thesis which she transformed into a bookWoody Woodpecker : Hero or villain ?
Social representation of the Child and Dominant Reproduction of Ideology ( Editor Loyola ) .
Last year , with the support of FAPESP , she finished the researchAnimated design on the TV : Myths , Symbols , and Metaphors .
Organized by the Research Laboratory on Childhood , Imaginary and Communication ( Lapic ) , which Dr. Elza directs at ECA , the research deepened the understanding developed by the professor about the relationship between the child and the television .
The work was carried out with the help of scholarship students of scientific novitiate and specialization .
The contribution of R $ 14,000 by FAPESP was a grant directed towards permanent and technical reserve material .
Dominant ideology
The research developed by Lapic based itself on interviews with 311 children from 5 to 11 years of age , resident in São Paulo .
Some time before , when she had done her research for her doctorate , Dr. Elza had surprised herself by noting that , after intense acquaintanceship and the work of interviewing children in public schools , which , contrary to what she had thought , the dominant ideology present in the cartoon designs in general had not influencedthe mind of the children .
However , she had already noted during that research , that the preference was always for North American cartoons , principally Woody Woodpecker , number one on the list of favorites .
It is not really so strange .
In the decade of the 80s , Brazil still did not have cable TV and the designs of Japanese origin had not become a mania among the youngsters .
The observation of the professor had been confirmed when she had visited Spain at the beginning of the 90s , when she had done her post doctorate at the Universidad Complutense of Madrid .
The discovery led her to question if the myths , symbols and the metaphors present in traditional cartoons such as Woody Woodpecker and others , were , as well as being the favorites , able to remain for a long time in the children 's preference , whilst technological cartoons and those of oriental origin caused great interest , but it was short-lived .
To study the nuances of these myths , she made use of , together with her researchers , a methodology which involves reflections of various psychological thinkers , in education and culture such as Freud , Piaget , Vigotsky , Melanie Klein , Winnicott and many more .
Clown 's clothes
The interviews were carried out in the public parks of Ibirapuera , Previdência , Água Branca , Independência and Aclimação in São Paulo .
To attract the children , the interviewers dressed in clown 's clothes .
" The environment of the park is appropriate because the more freedom the child feels , the more freely he will speak . "
When she took her doctorate , she first of all spend some time as a teacher in the schools , afterwards she carried out interviews , and when she already knew the favorite cartoons of the children , she showed some of the favorite episodes , in order to find out what were the motives as to why the children adored them so .
Woody Woodpecker also headed the list of favorites in the research carried out by Lapic , which was done between August of 1997 and December of 1999 .
On the list of favorites , Woody Woodpecker had 82 votes , followed by Goofy with 70 , Bugs Bunny with 58 , The Mask with 42 , and the Japanese Yu Yu Hakusho with 41 .
It was noted once again that the North American and traditional cartoons , many of them having been created in the decade of the 40s such as Woody Woodpecker and Bugs Bunny , were ahead of the Japanese cartoons which appeared in fifth place .
There are various reasons for this to happen , according to the explanation of the professor .
The language , based on the use of various close-ups and lots of movement , in the strong contrast between light and dark and in the strong notion of depth , makes the understanding difficult for the child between 5 and 11 years of age .
Small heroes
However , finally , what myths , symbols and metaphors are in the cartoons such as Woody Woodpecker , Bugs Bunny , Goofy and The Mask ?
" And it is to the small hero that the child self identifies . "
Immediately after , she affirmed , comes the question of good and evil , always present in these cartoons .
" In general , the antagonist is never good , as he always begins by wanting to take something from the protagonist , such as in the case of Tom and Gerry .
In the same way , the favorite Woody Woodpecker , commented the professor , is as well a dubious personality .
" He is aggressive , but only attacks who is provoking him . "
The transformation of the personalities is another item which makes these cartoons the most popular .
The fact that Ipkiss can transform himself into the Mask has the significance for the child of power and magic .
" It can be compared with the magician of the circus who takes what he wants from the top hat . "
As well , the non-existence of death calls the attention of the children .
" This is part of Western culture , because we adults are accustomed to hiding death from children as we are not prepared for it . "
The same does not happen in the culture and the cartoons of the orient , another factor which results in the children keeping themselves at a distance from the Japanese episodes .
Psychological time
The notion of time in the American cartoons is also important for the children .
" Metronome time doesn 't exist , only psychological time . "
explained Dr. Elza , and this , stated the professor , has a lot to do with the reality of the child .
" If he is playing and is called for lunch , he is furious because he is being taken from a moment of pleasure . "
It might not appear so , but the carrot of Bugs Bunny is an important element , as well as other objects of self esteem , shall we say , personality .
" We are speaking of transitional objects , as the nickname Winnicott , which represents the personality himself . "
" And there is also what I call " support ' " crutches .
Other symbols which contribute to the preference of certain cartoons are in the world of fantasy .
For example , the transgression of order , which does not normally happen in real life .
" For the child chaos doesn 't exist .
Who coordinates the world is the adult ; therefore he adores it when sees a transgression of order . "
In the same way , it is delightful for the child to see animals acting with personality , as if they were human beings .
The teacher and professor defends the use of cartoons in the educational process , even within schools .
" We have the tendency to want to protect our children from terror , but they defend themselves naturally from this , covering their eyes when the scenes are very frightening . "
" Our cartoons , in general , have a defense of oneself and a treatment of others as strangers . "
This has to be worked at by the family and even in the school .
According to Dr. Elza , the partnership of FAPESP in relation to the conclusions of Lapic indicate that the study is apt to be published , and should turn into a book .
More than acontribution towards a reflection about the relationship between children and television at a time when this means of communication appears to be more important even than other human relationships in the universe of the child , the study of Lapic is visionary in the sense of considering the child as a historic being and not someone who is always owing , to whom it only remains to ask what they are going to do when they grow up .

The irresistible Japanese invasion
The classics would appear to be the favorites of the infantile public as well when the question is about comic strips .
" A few years ago the preference was always for the comics with Walt Disney characters .
With time , Disney was substituted by Maurício de Souza , who as well overtook the American in terms of sales . " narrated the comic strip artist .
However , she analyzed , when the children turn into adolescents , around 12 years of age , they normally abandon the classics and divide themselves among the great heroes - the most sought after at the moment are X-Man , The Spaw and Batman who is for ever returning - and the mangás , the Japanese comic strips , from which came the animés , or that is , the Japanese animated cartoons .
" The great Oriental hero of the youngsters is Akira , a character who lives in the future , in the year 2050 . "
A portion of these youngsters , a small part , remain with the classics such as Asterix and Tin Tin .
For her , the taste both for comic strips and for Japanese animated cartoons is restricted to a public which is almost specialized in them .
" Those who read mangás don 't read any other kind of comic strip . "

Newton , the wizard of reason
A biography reveals a passion of the scientist for the occult
Keats did not forgive Newton for it " to have destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow , " therefore making , perhaps , the first criticism of the excessive scientific rationalism for which Sir Isaac , from that moment on , was enthroned as the most orthodox icon .
However , in truth , far from being the first representative of the Age of Reason , he was in truth " The last of the wizards , the last of the Babylonians and of the Sumarians , the last great mind which saw , as well as the visible and rational world , with the same eyes as those who began the construction of our intellectual inheritance " as defined another Englishman , Keynes .
The world preferred not to listen to the definition of Newton given by the celebrated economist in 1942 , after he had purchased at an action , manuscripts of Newton and had discovered , amazingly , the intense interest of the scientist for the world of the occult .
Michael White , the science editor of various English publications , took up the clue of 50 years previously and resolved to investigate .
The result is a surprising biography of the father of modern physics , Isaac Newton : the Last Wizard ( Record , 378 pages , R $ 40.00 ) , which reveals the intense interest of Newton for occultism and in which form this was responsible for his most important scientific discoveries .
" He was always considered a rigid scientist , a fierce adept of empiricism and nobody would have believed that he could have ideas at odds with the traditional scientific current .
White , of the more than 4 million words which Newton left written , 3 million refer to the world of the occult .
" It was alchemy , with its concept of a spirit of chemical affinity diffused through material and permitting the occurrence of chemical reactions , allied to the secret Aryanism of Newton and his notion of the spiritual body of Christ diffused through the universe , as a means through which material can move , which permitted him accepting that the force of gravity could operate at a pretended distance . "
The apple ?
Certainly , we already know that the story of the inspiration which Newton received by the falling of the fruit in front of his eyes , was not to be taken seriously .
What we didn 't know was who was the author of the fiction : nobody less than Sir Isaac himself .
" He invented this story to cover up the true line of occult rationality which he used to arrive at the force of gravity .
Newton , when he was old , wanted to disguise his alchemy studies and also to leave a posthumous image fascinating and deserving of his status as being the grand genius of his era .
" However , we must always bring ourselves back to his epoch and not judge him through our eyes .
For him , there was nothing wrong in , alongside the tools of science , throwing out the hand of knowledge extracted from the bible and from alchemy . "
It is enough , effectively , to remember that Newton , born in 1642 and who died in 1727 , lived at a time in which wars were made and men were assassinated for their religious beliefs and the meticulous analysis of theNature of light took place simultaneously with serious attempts to find the philosopher 's stone .
A long way from a diminutive Newton , we find a human and creative scientist .
" Until today , the majority of scientists don 't think in pure mathematical or empirical terms and are very imaginative persons .
Even the science which buried Newtonian physics , quantum mechanics , of which we are convinced , is not the most logic of theories and if we attempt to understand it only through reason , we shall not succeed . "
However , alchemy is not so distant from physics as our philosophy believes .
" The alchemists searched to unravel all the secrets of the universe of holistic form , as we call it today .
They were excellent observers of the physical world , whose workings they attempted to understand and explain as an alternative view to the universe .
" He was a very religious man and believed that it was his duty to disclose the secrets of the universe and there was only two ways of doing this : by studying the word of God , the bible , and the divine work , Nature .
He looked to reunite these universes in equilibrium . "
However , before this biography and that of Keynes , a contemporary had relieved the strange passion of the rational wiseman : his arch enemy Leibniz .
" Leibniz denounced that the concept of gravity was firmly linked to the world of occultism .
In actual fact , Newton allowed himself to fall into an intellectual trap when he attempted to hide his secret side .
As he saw himself penned in , without being able to reveal the source of his ideas , he proposed the idea of a hypothetical ether in an attempt to explain gravity .
This not only went to meet his disclosure compromising him with experimental reasoning , but as well left him exposed to the attack - for him something terrible , given his religious beliefs - that he was a mechanist . "
The scientist spent 40 years of his life persecuting his colleague Leibniz , in a campaign never before seen in the academic world , in order to destroy him , convinced that he has been robbed by his science companion in his formulation of calculus .
Newton was a detestable person , a bitter man , strange and recluse .
The legend says that he only laughed once in his life when they asked him what use he saw in Euclides .
This is undoubtedly an exaggeration but is not far off the mark of his real personality . " said White .
" When he was nineteen , he wrote out a list of the sins he had committed during his lifetime and that of number 13 is haunting : ' I wanted to burn my step-father and mother with the house on top of them . ' 
The following is not much better : ' I wished the deaths of a lot of people and would like it to really happen for some of them . ' 
In this way , if in his youth he carried out his research in the name of God , with the passing of time , he investigated science for his own self interest . "
The last of the wizards , though modestly feigned , saying , in truth , to have gotten to where he got by climbing on the shadow of giants who went before him , adored being adulated by his colleagues and , it is believed , persecuted all those who failed to treat him as a unique genius .
He was only extremely patient with a young student , the Swiss mathematician Nicholas Fatio de Duilier , with whom he maintained a torrid correspondence .
In reality , the apple may not have inspired his gravitational theory , but it gave other biblical ideas to Sir Isaac .
" Newton , everything leads us to believe , was a repressed homosexual who fell in love with Fatio in an intense form .
A large part of the letters between the two of them were destroyed by Newton himself to cover up the more revealing parts .
Even then , what remains is sufficient to lead to this hypothesis .
No matter how it was , after having suddenly stopped corresponding , the physicist suffered a dramatic nervous breakdown .
I believe that the reason for this was the refusal of the Swiss gentleman to come to live with him in England . "
This would not interest posterity if it had not been the catalyst for the end of Newtonian creativity .
" After this tragic event , he abandoned his interest in research and withdrew from public life , especially after his nomination as the Master of the Royal Mint . "
said the author " There Newton demonstrated the worst of his personality , transforming himself into a cruel , unpitying obsessive authoritarian , always in search of whatever attempt at falsification which was punished with excessive rigor .
" The same is true for his period as the President of the Royal Society which he governed with a steel fist , taking revenge on all of those who believed in his adversaries or those who were not respectful enough towards his scientific contributions . "
His first decree was to pull down from the wall and burn the portrait of his predecessor and critic , Robert Hooke .
" Even then , this coldness mingles with his ability to perceive the universe as if man - before the privileged observer , the measurer of everything - was a footnote of an irrelevant page . "

The relativity of Einstein
He submerged the universe zealously engendered by Newton , but , in the same way as his English colleague from the past , Albert Einstein also rose in the arms of gigantic obscurity .
This is one of the conclusions described in the book recently published in the USA , Einstein in Love : a Scientific Romance ( 416 pages , Viking , US $ 27.95 ) , by Dennis Overbye , the senior science editor of theThe New York Times .
According to him , following the footsteps of the arch enemy of Newton and Leibniz , Einstein postulated that space and time didn 't have objective reality .
" The book , in the same way as the biography of Newton by Michael White , also brings other " powers " to the celebrated scientist , especially his sentimental inconsistency , a sin which , it was just as well , he didn 't repeat in his professional life , remaining faithful all of his life to a unique conceptual philosophy of the world .
The same cannot be said , however , of his relationships with women who populated his existence .
Especially true in his youth , when the genius was very different from that saintly grandfather figure , tongue stuck out , which we are accustomed to seeing .
Overbye remembers that the physicist had an illegitimate child ( whose life is described in another recent book , Einstein Daughter : The Search for Lieserl , by Michele Zackheim ) , Lieserl , whom he never took any interest in seeing and could even have obliged the woman , Mileva , to put her up for adoption .
He also liked to beat up his poor wife , as soon as he could , betrayed her with her cousin , Elsa , who , a short time later he exchanged for another .
When his youngest son began to suffer from schizophrenia , Einstein rejected him .
According to the journalist , he was a misogynous man , an egotist and an incorrigible womanizer .
Overbye contradicts the long standing legend that the scientist had stolen ideas for his theory of relativity from his wife , Mileva , an experienced mathematician .
By the fact that he had published a proof , at 26 years of age , shortly after his marriage with e Serbian woman , the rumor went around which pursued for some time Einstein 's reputation .
However , says the book , apart from correcting some mathematical equations , Mileva , at that time , was more worried about raising her children and leaving her husband free to think .
Even then , in order to obtain a separation , he was obliged to promise to her the money that he would receive if he was to win the Nobel prize .

Risk capital and technology : a marriage of interests
Development Agencies propose the union of investment funds with technology based companies to capitalize and to favor the creation of innovative products
Claudia Izique and Marcos de Oliveira
After having given an impulse to business on the Internet , risk capital has its eye on new markets .
It has begun to adjust its focus to the small and medium companies emerging from a technological base , with capacity to develop products and innovative processes and with a large potential for growth in the market .
Known throughout the world asventure capital , risk capital was fundamental for the development of companies such as Microsoft , Compaq , Sun and Federal Express , if only to cite some very successful examples .
In Brazil , risk capital is emerging as a possible alternative for small technological companies whose development could be compromised by the cost of money on the national market or even by the difficulty of obtaining financial resources in the banking sector , given the requirement of guarantees with property and signed agreements , among others , to which in the majority of cases these companies cannot comply .
Risk capital could make possible the expansion of new products in a way that they effectively translate themselves into commercial results .
The guarantee of the investment , in this case , is the good idea , along with a solid business plan .
The investor or investment fund would participate in the enterprise by way of the acquisition of shares or through buying into the emergent company .
This participation normally gets to 40 % of the total capital , which permits the capital investor to give his opinion and formally participate , for example , on the Board of Directors of the company .
Risk capital is , at the moment , long term financing of between two and ten years , generally recoverable after the development of the company by way of the offering of shares on the market or of the total or partial sale of the enterprise .
This manner of investing could , for example , be an option to produce a leap forward in the 129 companies whose present research of innovative technology has received the support of FAPESP by way of the Program of Innovative Technology in Small Businesses ( PIPE ) , and which need to bring to the marketplace the new products or services which are being developed .
The PIPE , as has persistently been divulged , designates itself to the stimulation of innovative technological research in small Paulista businesses with at the maximum 100 employees , and deploys itself in two phases .
In the first , with a time span of up to six months , the company receives up to a maximum of R $ 75,000.00 from FAPESP to develop studies of the technical and commercial viabilityof the project .
During the second phase , assuming good results have been presented in the previous phase , the project receives additional resources of up to a maximum of R $ 300,000,00 for the carrying out of the proposed research during a period of at the maximum two years .
The Foundation does not grant resources for a third phase , the commercial implementation of the project , when it falls upon the company to assume the financial responsibility for its development .
However , they still have at this point the support of FAPESP to look for financing from other sources , such as the Brazilian Service of Support of Micro and Small Companies ( Sebrae ) and the Financier of State Projects ( Finep , an organ linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology ) which relates directly to the market , supporting production .
Within its policy of support for innovative technology and small businesses , FAPESP promoted , on the morning of 29th of November , in its auditorium , and with the collaboration of Finesp and of Endeavor Brasil , the seminar " Innovative Technology and Risk Capital . "
During the talks and debates which were part of the event , the researchers and entrepreneurs who participated on behalf of PIPE were introduced to the Project Inovar of Finep , and of the proposal of Endeavor Brasil , a non-governmental organization which promotes entrepreuneurship in developing countries .
Venture capital
The Project Inovar is one of the newest initiatives of Finep within its policy of inducement for the development of technology in the country .
In partnership with other development agencies , the proposal of Inovar is to create an institutional background which stimulates the growth of the participation of risk capital in projects involving innovative technology in Brazil .
Its strategy works through the creation of an encompassing institutional structure , capable of bringing together operatives of the risk capital market who are as yet dispersed throughout the national economy .
The project invests in the creation of physical and virtual space - such as Venture Forums and the Risk Capital Doorway to Brazil - for those who need to converge both businesses and investors .
At the same time , Finep , in cooperation with the National Association of Incubators ( Anprotec ) and the Softex Society , are working at strategies to prospect and develop new and promising businesses by way of the Inovar Network .
Another part of the agenda of the project is the implementation of programs of qualifying professionals who specialize in the evaluation of emerging businesses based on technology , in partnership with teaching institutions and with the participation of specialists in the area of risk capital .
The project includes the creation of a support structure which also permits the entrepreneurs to draft out business plans in the fashion required by the market . " Even
underlined Ávilla.Inovar wants to initially group together US $ 400 million for investments in emerging businesses .
Its strategy will be to stimulate the constitution of funds , and for this the project will directly apply R $ 100 million , an initial amount resulting from a partnership among Finep , Sebrae , the Interamerican Development Bank ( BID ) and the Pension Fund of Petrobras ( Petros ) .
From that point onwards , the intention is to attract new investors in a way as to multiply by four the initial capital .
As well as capturing funds from national investors , there is the intention of making a road show with Brazilian funds so as to capture resources in the exterior .
At this point , of the R $ 100 million to be invested directly by Inovar , R $ 30 million were made available to the Brasil Venture Fund of support for small businesses based on technology .
Attracting capital
In order to be a candidate for the resources of the investment funds capitalized by Inovar , the company must made its application through the Risk Capital Doorway ( www.venturecapital.com.br ) .
The projects are evaluated by committees of investments of each fund .
The companies selected will be guided as to the drafting out of a business plan and their projects will be presented to interested investors .
The fifteen best assessed plans will be invited to participate in the Venture Forums , organized by Inovar , which will unite entrepreneurs in search of resources and investors in search of good opportunities for investment .
The cost of inscription is R $ 1,000.00 with the right to a true " window dressing " before the presentation of the project to the investors , which includes formal training , individual consulting and even a general rehearsal of a 12 minute presentation on the eve of the meeting .
For the first Venture Forum , which took place in Rio de Janeiro , 14 projects from the 300 which were inscribed , were selected .
A biotechnology company and a software company have already closed out agreements for the capture of resources , which requires that their names cannot be identified .
The second Venture Forum occurred on the 14th and 15th of December in Porto Alegre .
30 companies from the 400 candidates were pre-selected and of those 12 companies were classified to be presented to the investors .
The next meeting will be in São Paulo during April of 2001 , at a date as yet to be finalized .
The goal is to pre-select 40 emerging companies and to elect 20 finalists .
The inscription , through the Doorway , finishes on the 4th of February and the selection will be done during the 12th and 13th of February .
As well as Inovar , the technology companies can also approach risk capital investors via the intermediation of Endeavor , a North American Non-Governmental Organization ( ONG ) , created by a group of ex-students of the University of Harvard .
Endeavor has been in Brazil since June of this year .
The organization is made up of a board and assisted byventure corps , a group of executives with considerable experience in the market , which takes the role of orientator to the entrepreneurs when negotiating with the market .
stated Marilia Rocca , Director-General of Endeavor.The focus of attention of this organization is the innovation and the entrepreneur , not the company .
The objective is to incentivate the risk capital through the interaction investor-entrepreneur .
As well as the technical and methodology criteria in the selection of the projects , there are also observed the profile of the proponent and the potential growth of the project .
The entrepreneurs selected receive orientation from professionals with Masters in Business Administration ( MBA ) , graduates in Brazilian and North American universities .
As well , they can count upon the support of assessors of a high level for the definition of judicial aspects and for the registration of a patent or for the analysis of the market , among other aspects which give consistency to the project .
In the first selection which took place in Brazil , 350 candidates inscribed .
At the end only four were considered qualified to receive the assistance of Endeavor .
" In a certain manner , " said Marília Rocca , " the fact that only four companies survived , was reflected in the climate of euphoria through the Internet , which provoked various types of misunderstandings in the minds of people .
There were lots of ideas , but not company projects . "
Administrative experience
The first company to obtain financing by intermediary of the ONG was the firm from the State of Santa Catarina , Nano Endoluminal , which produces prosthesis for the treatment of aneurysm .
This company , besides , won the Finep Award for Innovative Technology 2000 .
Another three proposals are under negotiation : that of Solvo Automatos , from Rio de Janeiro , a company in distance telemetry , that of Rede Omega , from Curitiba , which develops wireless solutions telecommunications without wire ) , and of MultiDelivery , from São Paulo , in the logistics of food distribution .
For giving all the assistance up until the point of receiving financial support , Endeavor receives a 2 % participation in the partnership of the company .
Among the rejected projects , some could be re-presented , such as , for example , the Paulista projects e-Fotos , which carries out digital developing via the Internet , and SOS Stress , for the treatment of stress using multi-media resources .
One of the partners of Endeavor in the support of entrepreneurs is GP Investimentos , which administers two funds with a total of US $ 1.3 billion , and has participation in companies such as Telemar and Globo Cabo .
Around a year and a half ago , GP began to invest in technologies on the Internet and helped in the take off of companies such as Patagom.com .
Now it is diversifying its portfolio of investments .
This , as well , is a tendency of the market confirmed by Carlos Steffen , a partner in Steffen e Pozzi , a consulting company with its headquarters in Porto Alegre .
" We have information on more than 30 national and foreign funds which affirm to be interested in diversifying their investments in technology projects but out of the field of the Internet . "
In the first stage there are invested resources for the launching of the business and the initial operation of the company .
In the second and third stages , the strategy is to look for co-investors to expand and consolidate the company .
" In the final stage , " he said " theventure capitalists look for remuneration for their investments and the alternatives range from the strategic sale of the company to the launch of shares on the stock market . "
The business plan is essential , but as well the entrepreneur must show the capacity to execute it , to have an understanding of the market potential and of his position in relation to competitors .
The proposals are evaluated by taking into consideration the sources of income , the risk and above all the size and the market prospects .
Co-agreement Fund
The Secretary of Science , Technology and Economic Development , José Anibal Peres Pontes , present at the opening of the meeting on risk capital sponsored by FAPESP , informed the businessmen that the Government of the State of São Paulo will begin to operate in January , a Co-agreement Fund with resources from the National Bank of Economic and Social Development ( BNDES ) , directed towards the productive chains and special products such as those developed by small technology companies .
" The Fund will co-sign 80 % of the credit operations of these companies .
They are resources for the financing of machinery , equipment and for turnover capital . "
" Innovative technology is a basic condition for an active position in relation to the economy .
Either one has the capacity to accumulate excellence or one does not go ahead . "
The obstacle race
In the process of evaluation , the entrepreneur must reply to the following questions made by the investor
What is the market ?
Make an evaluation of the size and of the prospects in the segment which you will be going into .
What are the incomes ?
Explain the prospects for sales , the sources of income of the product and the index of growth of the company .
What are the margins ?
Elaborate the percentages cost price to sales price and give a perspective of the time before showing a profit .
Who are the team ?
Show the curriculums with the qualities of each person who will be included in the project .
What are the risks ?
Analyze the competition , new technologies and the legal aspects .

Risk Capital ( venture capital )
It is every sort of the investment practiced by companies , persons , or investment funds ( banking institutions or not ) in the financing of companies being formed or recently formed and technology based which have good prospects for development .
The risk is of investing in something new , many times untested on the market , but which , if it goes well , the owners of the money are going to make a profit many time more than the normal application offered by the financial market .
The capital sum is given in exchange for the acquisition of shares or of the buying of part of the company , normally lower than 40 % , which guarantees the provider of risk capital the participation in the destiny of the company as he is normally part of the Board of Directors .
In some cases this type of accompaniment does not exist .
Theventure capital is always a long term financing , from two to ten years , generally recovered after the development of the company when a total or partial sale of the business takes place with the offer of shares on the open market .
Angel Investors
As well as acquiring participation in the enterprise , not necessarily through shares but as minor partners , they can participate as excellent advisors in the company , since , normally , they have experience in business administration .
After the circle of family and friends , they are the best bet to make a financial investment ( less than the investment companies and investment funds ) in an emerging company .
Business Plan
The presentation of the project of the company in an ample and detailed form .
In this plan there should be detailed the objectives of the enterprise , the method of production and management , marketing and plans for the product .
As well , there should be an analysis of the prospects and of the current situation of the specific market with details about the future profitability of the company .
Money with participation
The story of two companies which grew through risk capital
Fifty million US dollars .
This was the result of a pilgrimage of three partners of the Paulista company comDomínio from 20 banks and investment funds in the United States in search of capital which will be risked in the first company in Brazil ofInternet Hosting Centers , ordata centers .
This is an enterprise specializing in the hosting of sites , providers and other types of equipment for companies of all sizes which integrate themselves to the world network of computers .
The three partners are a professor of the Institute of Chemistry at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) Fernando Reinach , the ex-President of BNDES and of the Central Bank , Pérsio Arida and the administrator Lúcia Hauptman , who has worked with several investment banks .
His experience on the Internet is history .
He was one of the coordinators of the information technology commission which , in 1986 , implanted the Internet in USP .
At that time the network was still restricted to the academic world .
In November of 1999 , the three partners mounted the company with two other employees .
They made a detailed business plan and went out to do battle .
They began the process of obtaining money in May of that year and by August they had already closed the deal with JP Morgan and could count on US $ 50 million deposited in the company 's account .
Though they prefer to remain silent about the fraction of the company which remained with the bank , Reinach affirmed that " It was more than 50 % . "
Even when buying the major part of the company , JP Morgan has nobody in the administration of comDomínio .
In truth , the three partners didn 't even need to go to the United States to close the deal with JP Morgan .
They discovered during the negotiations that the bank has an office in São Paulo where it also receives projects from emerging companies .
" They are looking for new projects .
After installing the company and getting it working , the partners will complete by the end of this year the hiring of 70 employees which make up comDomínio in São Paulo .
In the plans for the company is the installation of four more data centers .
As well as the same services given to its clients , these enterprises are installed in buildings with between 5 and 6 thousand m2 connected to fiber optics which interlink them to all of the skeleton of the Internet network .
To produce 40 types of monoclonal antibodies for clinical examinations , as well as acting as tumor markers , he managed to obtain the financial support of R $ 625,000.00 from the Investment Fund for Emerging Companies ( RSTec ) of the Companhia Riograndense de Participações ( CRP ) , which has as its shareholders a group of private investors , such as the groups Gerdau and Ipiranga , as well as the Interamerican Development Bank ( BID ) and Banrisul , belonging to the State government .
To acquire the investment , Dr. Kreutz detailed out , with the assistance of a consultant from Sebrae , a business plan of 150 pages .
" It was a piece of work very commercially detailed , with 50 tables , projecting the plans of cost , sales and profit . "
For the financial support , 25 % of the shares of FK were passed to CRP .
Before this investment , which occurred in August of this year , Dr. Kreutz received financing from a Canadian angel investor to the value of US $ 20,000 .
This investor is a friend of Dr. Kreutz from the time that he worked in Canada between 1996 and 1998 , as a researcher in the biotechnology company Alta Rex .
The Canadian participation in the company is of 2 % of the 75 % which remained with the founder of FK .
Cancer treatment
Dr. Kreutz is a professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) and the products which he began to produce in February don 't have anything similar in Brazil .
Here , other companies import the reagents and mount the kits .
The development of antibodies and of the markers is a result of ten years of work at the UFRGS .
For this participation , the University will receive royalties when sales begin .
Dr. Kreutz is also pursuing an experimental technique of otology vaccine ( made from material of the patient himself ) for the treatment of cancer , and which has already lead to the solicitation of a patent at the National Institute of Industrial Property ( INPI ) .
With an eye on the market
A symposium debates intellectual property in order to stimulate patents
The protection of intellectual production , by way of the registration of patents , may guarantee that one part of the knowledge generated in the university laboratories and research centers results in financial benefit to the researcher , the institution and for the country .
In Brazil only 10 % of Brazilian intellectual production is protected through patents .
However , the Brazilian academic , little by little , is discovering the importance of registering their inventions , with an eye on the market .
The most recent contribution to this debate was theScientia 2000 symposium : Intellectual Property for the Academy , which took place on the 13th and 14th of November on the campus of the Oswaldo Cruz , Foundation in Rio de Janeiro .
The meeting brought together more than 120 specialists and representatives of research centers and foreign universities , who spoke about their experiences in the generation of intellectual property in First World countries , to a platform composed of administrators of research and university organs in Brazil , lawyers , scientists and students .
For Simone Scholze , of the Ministry of Science and Technology and one of the organizers of the symposium , what is required is that universities and research centers in the country define strategies for the protection of intellectual property .
One of the paths , which he suggests , is the mobilization of managers of science and technology who have as their focus of attention possible economic results coming from the research .
" The scientist is preoccupied with developing his research and publishing his article , which in itself is natural .
Hence it falls to the managers to create the structure necessary for the generation of patents . "
Scholze remembered that , through there exist methods in Brazil for regularizing the question of intellectual ownership , the universities and the research centers are not yet adapted , from the administrative point of view , to operating the resources generated through patents .
" Many institutions and universities don 't have regulations for the distribution of royalties , nor specific written guidelines for patents . "
In the evaluation of Cláudia Chamas , of Fiocruz , one of the organizing entities of the event , it is necessary to have a greater dissemination of information in relation to the protection of intellectual property within the country , principally at this moment in time , in which the Brazilian scientists are publishing more and more of their results in international magazines .
Incentive
The seminar showed different realities in thecurrent Brazilian situation in the area of protection of intellectual property .
Frederic Erbisch , of the University of Michigan , explained that two decades ago , changes in the North American legislation , resulted in an increase in the number of research patents required by the Universities of the country .
The so calledBayh-Dole Act , a law of 1980 , which regulated the registering of research patents financed through the North American government within the universities , was the principal instrument for incentivating patents .
Erbisch stated that the inventions and patents generated by the universities made it possible that in 1998 , 2,500 new companies and businesses were created .
" More or less 70 % of these businesses are still operating with success . "
Erbisch , more than 289,000 jobs were created linked to the commerce of new technology coming from the academic world.Over the past 20 years , more than 20,000 patents from American universities have been registered .
" Just at the University of Michigan in 1998 , we received close to US $ 24 million in royalties for our patents . "
TheBayh-Dole Act also provoked other changes .
Between 1980 and 1990 there were created more than 200 offices for the transfer of technology and the registration of patents within the American university system .
The North American success has also served as a model for other developed countries .
For example , Japan recently created a law similar to that ofBayh-Dole to stimulate the registering of patents in the university circuit .
In school
Countries such as Germany have programs which stimulate learning about intellectual property while still at school .
Stefanie Winkler , of the Ministry of Education and Research of Germany , informed that the question is included for pupils in the secondary school curriculum of the country .
" It is the first contact that the pupil gets with this theme which certainly will be met with again at university . "
Bernard Hertel , a physicist who directs Garching Innovation , linked to the Max-Planck Institute , explained the workings of the office of patents and transfer of technology of the German institution , presenting its main attributions .
According to him , the professionals within the office carry out the mediation of the complete process : from the relationship with the scientists-inventors at the center of the research , to the lawyers , and even maintain contact with industry for the economic approval of the innovation .
It wasn 't by chance that the presentation given by Hertel had the title From the Ivory Tower to the Stock Exchange . "
The office looks after the patenting of inventions for 81 research institutes which are integrated with the Max-Planck Institute .
Jens Tampe , of the Fraunhofer Center of Patents for research in Germany , emphasized that within the academic world of the country the question of intellectual ownership has been consolidated .
He further explained that for some time now , it is required that the researcher has on his curriculum at least one patent .
Tampe , one of the factors which served as an inspiration for this new situation was the appearance of North American companies in the area of biotechnology founded by scientists from the decade of the 80s onwards .
" The success of these companies called the attention of the German scientists who rapidly paid attention to the viability of the economic utilization of their research . "
The universities had to adapt to the new reality .
" Before , for the German scientist , science and economics weren 't to be mixed .
Tampe emphasized that the universities still fall short by not maintaining fixed budgets for their patenting offices and by not offering greater opportunities for the training of the professionals in this sector .
Law on the agenda
The judicial aspects of patents was on the agenda of the debates.Bernhard
Fischer , a specialist lawyer from the Max Planck Institute of Germany , affirmed that in actual fact there is an immense discussion in Europe over the so called right of experimental use of patents - when the knowledge of the invention or of the innovation are revealed and used for research purposes .
Dr. Fischer stated that there exist judicial decisions contesting the right of experimental use .
" Various companies have come out victorious and guaranteeing the monopoly of the knowledge in detriment to the petition of the scientists who solicited the experimental use of the patent . "
The group who related their experiences in the administration of intellectual property in institutions of Israel , the United States and Great Britain , had as their moderator Edgar Dutra Zanotto , Assistant Coordinator to the Scientific Board of FAPESP .
Dr. Zanotto gave an outline of the Foundation and spoke about the recent organization of the Núcleo de Patenteamento e Licenciamento de Tecnologia ( Nuplitec ) [ Center of Patenting and Licensing of Technology ] for the protection of intellectual property and above all , for its licensing .
Peter Bailey , of the oldest patenting office in the world , the British Technology Group ( BTG ) , founded 50 years ago , affirmed that the transference of technology and the obtaining of patents require multi-disciplinary teams , ready to evaluate the economic potential of the research , to study the best methods of protecting it , as well as conceiving marketing strategies for putting the product on the market .
The BTG has 180 professionals spread throughout diverse areas of the work .
In 1995 the organization began to have its shares sold on the London Stock Exchange .
Bailey related that the BTG has even gone to the point of mounting companies in order to develop new products .
" Recently we organized a company solely to develop a new medicine for the treatment of varicose veins . "
Renée Ben-Israel , of the Yssum Research Development Company , who defends the rights of the researchers at the Hebraica University of Jerusalem , stated that the company registers on average between 45 and 55 patents from the university each year .
Ben-Israel affirmed that the company Yssum works as a commercial arm of the university .
" Our tariff is to say if the invention is patentable , if it will be commercially attractive , the exact date to deposit the patent before itbecomes obsolete . "
The organizers are planning new seminars to amplify the debates about the theme .
There is already scheduled for the end of the first semester of 2001 the realization , in São José dos Campos , SP , of a symposium to discuss the relations of the research institutes , notably those installed in the city , such as the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais ( Inpe ) , [ National Institute of Spatial Research ] , along with the industries .
The meeting , which will have the support of the World Organization of Intellectual Property , will evaluate the possibilities of the transference and intellectual protection of new technologies between centers of research and industry and the prospects for a greater approximation between the two segments .
" Companies have familiarity with the commercial side of innovative technology and the academic world with the knowledge .
The debates and the presentations ofScientia 2000 will be divulged in a special publication to be edited in a partnership among Fiocruz , MCT and the Foundation Konrad Adenauer of Germany .

A new network for the viruses
Project will study the genetics of four organisms with high incidences in São Paulo
FAPESP has just finished creating theRede de Diversidade Genética de Vírus , the VGDN ( in English the Viral Genetic Diversity Network ) , a consequence of FAPESP 's Genome Program .
The VGDN is going to be leaning towards this class of micro organism which houses the smallest agents which cause the infectious processes known to us .
Though they have only a small genome , their study is fundamental for understanding the diversity among their strains and their mutations .
The network has as its objective over the next four years , the genetic variations of four viruses : the HIV-1 , the type of Aids most common in Brazil ; the HCV , the agent responsible for hepatitis C ; the Hantavirus , which provokes an as yet mysterious lung syndrome ; and the VRS ( sinusitis respiratory virus ) , responsible for infections in the respiratory tract , mostly in children .
Budgeted at US $ 8 million , the program will create a State network of 17 laboratories , with the intention of radiographing the mutations and genetic varieties of the viruses by way of samples of these pathological agents collected from the principle regions of the State of São Paulo .
As well as being organisms with unstable genetic structures , the four viruses of the new project have characteristics in common , a fact which lent weight to their choice as the objects of the study by the VGDN .
All of them cause sicknesses for which there is a high rate of mortality , and for which there is no vaccine .
With the exception of the syndrome caused by Hantavirus , an illness still considered to be rare , the other maladies present high indices of occurrence in State .
When the work of the mapping of these four viruses is completed , the VGDN will turn itself into a permanent network and will probably be incorporated into the Secretary of Health of the State , which will use it to radiograph the genetic varieties of other micro organisms .
The edict with the rules for the laboratories interested in inscribing into the project is already available on the Internet on the homepage of FAPESP ( www.fapesp.br ) .
The coordination of the Genome Virus is the responsibility of a committee with members from the participating project institutions , bringing together specialists in virology , epidemiology and bioinformatics : Paolo Zanotto , Marcos Dimas Gubitoso , Edison Luiz Durigon , Eduardo Massad , João Renato Rebelo Pinho , José Cassis de Moraes , Ester Cerdeira Sabino and Leda Jamal .
Three large centers will group together the research developed by the network and will have the function of coordinating the work of the sequencing and analysis of the genetic material of one or more of the viruses .
The Foundation Pro-Blood Hemocenter São Paulo and the Center of Reference and Training into DST / Aids of the Secretary of Health of the State will be responsible for the coordination of the work with HIV-1 .
The Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo ( ICB- USP ) will be the center of reference for the VRS , as well as administering all the part of bioinformatics .
The Adolfo Lutz Institute will have the tariff of supervising the analysis of the data on the two viruses , HCV and Hantavírus .
The project will also be able to count on the support of two other units of USP : the Institute of Mathematics which will look after the computational support and the Faculty of Medicine which will occupy a part of the medical information program .
Importance
Why is it important to study the genetic diversity of the viruses most common in São Paulo ?
Wouldn 't it be enough to analyze the data produced in the exterior about these micro organisms and adapt it to the reality of the State or of the country ?
No , it wouldn 't be enough .
As they are organisms with unstable DNA , composed of mutant and recombined genes ( the union of two or more genes which results in a new and different gene ) the strains of the HIV-1 , HCV , VRS and Hantavirus in the majority of the cases in São Paulo could be very different from those found outside .
The case of the agent responsible for Aids clearly demonstrates to illustrate the importance of understanding in detail the genetic outline of a virus , in a given location .
There are two major types of Aids virus in the world , the HIV-1 , dominant in Europe and in the Americas , and the HIV-2 , present above all in West Africa .
Each one of these types of virus presents different behavior with respect to a series of parameters such as the speed of the progress of the infection and responding to treatment .
To complicate things even more , the HIV-1 has shown itself in the form of more or less nine sub-types designated by the letters A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H and I .
The HIV-2 , for its part , has more or less five sub-types , also nominated by the letters ( A , B , C , D and E ) .
As if this wasn 't enough , there are rare varieties of the virus which contain pieces of HIV-1 and of HIV-2 in their genetic structure .
For apparently being the most common variety encountered throughout the world , the HIV-1 of sub-type B is used in many agreements of the treatment of the disease and in tests of vaccines as the main virus of Aids .
And there is the danger .
In the end , there are no detailed information showing that it is really dominant in all the areas of the State of São Paulo and in Brazil .
" We 've got to understand our viruses .
If we don 't do this , one day there could appear a laboratory wanting , for example , to sell an Aids based on a determined variety of HIV .
What would we do then if we didn 't have at our finger tips the details about the types of virus that we have here ?
In the same way as HIV-1 , the other three viruses which are the objectives of the project also present various known sub-types ( the HCV has at least six identified varieties ) without counting on the ignored strains .
Autonomy
As well as generating data which will result in research in the area of virology , to have an effective and permanent network of laboratories capable of tracing and monitoring the genetic profile of the viruses , will also augment the capacity for action by the State .
When it will be functioning at full speed , the VGDN will confer international autonomy and agility to the State to be able to carry out analysis at critical moments .
In the middle of an epidemic , for example , it could provide a radiography almost in real time of the strain of the virus which is causing the outbreak .
Today there exist few centers capable of carrying out this type of tariff such as the Adolfo Lutz Institute .
However , there is missing a more comprehensive network which can coordinate , group together , and when necessary , concentrate efforts to realize common objectives .
A network such as the VGDN would have been very useful to the Paulista population in 1997 .
During that year there was a measles epidemic which intrigued the Brazilian infectologists and became world news .
Inexplicably , as well as children , a large number of adults , some vaccinated , also developed the sickness .
At the time , public officials of the CDC ( Center of Disease Control ) in Atlanta , United States , gathered samples of the virus which circulated around here .
As it was not a priority of the CDC , which occupies itself fundamentally with health problems in North America , the results of these analysis were only available some time afterwards when the epidemic had already been put under control .
The data served to enrich the studies on the disease , without a doubt , but didn 't help in the least to deter the advance of the outbreak .
Small DNA
Compared with the genetic material of other species , the DNA of a virus is very small .
It has a few thousand , sometimes dozens or hundreds of thousands of pairs of bases , the chemical groupings which form the basis of life .
In the four types of virus to be studied , the number of pairs of bases is not greater than fifteen thousand .
That is to say , for the effect of comparison , the genome of each of these pathological agents is , at the least , 180 times smaller than all of the genetic code of the bacteriaXylella fastidiosa which causes the yellowing of oranges ( 2.7 million pairs of bases ) , the first organism sequenced through the FAPESP Genome Project .
If confronted with the size of the human DNA , 3 billion pares of bases , the genetic material of the viruses takes on airs even more negligible : it has 200,000 times less in the chemical groupings than that of the genetic code ofHomo Sapiens .
Since it is very small , the genetic material of the viruses , in theory , should not offer any great difficulty to being totally sequenced .
In the exterior , various samples of HIV-1 , HCV , Hantavirus and VRS have had their DNA mapped in an integrated manner .
As was already said , the challenge of the project is not to simply produce complete genomes of the viruses - but to sequence and analyze a large quantity of samples of these pathological agents coming from all of the State , with the objective of obtaining a general panorama of the genetic diversity of the virus and of establishing which strains are strongest .
With this intention , each one of the 17 participating laboratories of the program should generate 4,350,000 pairs of bases of HCV , 4,180,350 of HIV-1 , 1,200,000 de VRS and 180,000 of Hantavirus .
On average , each nucleotide ( pair of bases ) should be sequenced five times .

In search of new designer drugs
Structural Genome will have US $ 3.5 million to study genes and proteins
The Structural Genome Project , launched this month by FAPESP in partnership with the National Laboratory of Polarized Light ( LNLS ) , linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology , will begin its activities in March of 2001 .
The Project , which has resources of the order of US $ 3.5 million , will initiate the structural phase of the Genome Projects of FAPESP , with the emphasis being on the Human Genome Cancer Project ..
It is expected to study the structure of proteins so as to understand their function and the possible development of medicines to combat the various types of cancer .
The first stage of the Structural Genome , with a working period of four years , involves the study of close to 200 expressive genes and their protein .
The genes will be selected and given from the various projects of the Genome Program of FAPESP , especially from the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research , the coordinating center of the Human Genome Cancer Project .
The Center of Molecular Structural Biology ( CBME / LNLS ) will be responsible for the coordination of the work of the Structural Genome .
The Project will be developed , in the first instance , at close to 15 laboratories of both the public and private sectors in the State of São Paulo .
The edital can already be found at the electronic address of FAPESP .
Laboratories interested in joining the project should present their proposals / projects until the 23rd of February of 2001 .
Preference will be given to laboratories with experience in the sequencing of DNA and of the cloning of genes .
During the first few weeks of March , up to US $ 1.5 million will begin to be liberated among the selected laboratories .
Each laboratory will be able to count upon , at the maximum , US $ 100,000 for the development of the research .
The values should be applied , in the majority of cases , to the purchase of equipment and reagents , explained the biochemist Dr. Rogério Meneghini , the Director of CBME , who will coordinate the program .
The equipment will be primarily that needed for the expression , purification and crystallization of proteins and the laboratories which already possess them will contribute to lowering the cost of the investment of FAPESP .
On the other hand , in a short period of time the CBME will be able to count on a number of spectroscopic pieces of equipment , including nuclear magnetic resonance , to study the structure of the proteins in solution , without the necessity of crystallizing them .
Among the criteria for the selection of the group , one of the main ones is interest in the domination of techniques of purification and crystallization of proteins so that their 3-dimensional structures can come to be unraveled .
The knowledge of these structures will be important for the definition of the functions of the proteins in normal cells which will be compared , for example , with cancerous cells .
After having de-codified the structure and the functions of the proteins and the way in which they work in determined types of illnesses , the researchers could start on a more advanced phase of this process , the development of inhibitors of their activities ( designer drugs ) , conceived with the purpose of blocking the activities of the proteins which show themselves in an exaggerated form in cancerous cells .
The determination of the 3-dimensional structure of a protein should be achieved by way of the methods of crystallography in sources of polarized light which use the phenomena of the diffraction of x-rays of the molecular crystals of the proteins , and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy .
This technology demands that the laboratories can count on specialized personnel and that they are equipped with apparatus used in structural molecular biology and related areas , which permits - as well as being able to operate processes of extraction , selection , purification and crystallization - the collection of the data on the protein which is being studied , normally by techniques of NMR or x-rays coming from a polarized light source for example .
According to Dr. Meneghini , the Ministry of Science and Technology has determined an allocation of US $ 3.7 million for the budget of 2001 of CBME / LNLS , which will permit that the laboratories of other States can integrate themselves into the network lead by FAPESP .
The selected groups will also have the liberty of proposing the study of the proteins in which their own research projects are interested and which have nothing to do with the Genome Projects of FAPESP .
The Scientific Director of FAPESP , Dr. José Fernando Perez , observed that the Structural Genome Project carries a multiple significance because , as well as progressing down the line of the FAPESP Genome Project , which began with the sequencing of the genome ofXylella fastidiosa , it facilitates professional training and unites , for the first time in the country , teams of professionals from various disciplines .
Physicists , computer scientists , biochemists and biologists are following only one objective : the production of designer drugs , the new world tendency in science .
" Now lets go from the research line to the pharmaceutical line .
It is a tremendous challenge , a risky activity , as is everything in science , and we are entering into a very new area at the same time as similar researches are being carried out by the Americans and the Europeans . "
A positive approval
The Structural Genome Project was submitted to the analysis of an international scientific committee at the beginning of the year and approved six months later .
The researches into structural genome in the world are focused on the functional spectrum ( or dynamism ) of the activities of the Human Genome Project .
Firstly came the deciphering and annotations of part of the human genetic code ( close to 90 % ) , then the transcription of DNA in RNA ( Transscriptomes ) ; and the analysis of the groups of proteins ( Proteomes ) , of fundamental importance for the understanding of the molecular game of the living organisms because it is those who command the spectrum of life .
He believes that , during this decade , it will be possible to arrive at the first group of products of structural genome - the perfecting of the forms of the diagnosis of cancers , treatments of the most varied types and inhibitors for protein molecules active in diseases of those currently most serious .

New project faces new forms of therapy and diagnosis of cancer
After basic science comes the application .
Based on the information generated by the Human Cancer Genome , a project financed by FAPESP and by the Ludwig Institute , the Clinical Cancer Genome is beginning to take shape .
Announced publicly on the 20th of December , it should be able to depend on the participation of researchers from the State of São Paulo who work in clinical and surgical activities related to oncology .
The objective is to develop new forms of diagnostics and treatment .
The inscription for the new groups will be open until the end of February ( more information at the electronic address www.fapesp.br ) .
In almost two years , the Human Cancer Genome team accumulated one million sequences of genes active in diverse types of tumor - of the breast , of the stomach , of the head and neck , of the colon and of the prostate , among others .
" The definition of the areas of study will depend on the demands of the groups who present themselves . "
The teams incorporated into the project - coordinated by a clinical researcher or surgeon preferentially linked to the research institutions - are going to participate in two manners .
The first will be by way of sending the tumor samples , which will be stored and analyzed by the laboratories of the Human Cancer Genome Project and the second by accompanying the clinical state of the patients .
Today the analysis of DNA is done for few types of cancer .
One case is that of chronic myeloid leukemia , whose gravity can be evaluated by way of the presence or absence of a mutation , the so called chromosome Ph1 or Philadelphia , which results from the fusion of a piece of Chromosome 9 with that of 22 .
Without this mutation , stated the researcher , this type of leukemia presents a faster evolution and a greater resistance to treatment than whenever it is present .
" Cancer is not really an illness , " commented Dr. Zago , " but a model of an illness in which the genetic material of the cell is altered in some way and it gains autonomy of growth , without further responding to the controls of the organism . "
For this reason , one type of cancer is different from another from the molecular point of view , though it manifests itself in a similar fashion when examined from the point of view of the tissues which they affect .
The Clinical Genome Project should begin with close to 20 groups of researchers and an allocation of US $ 1 million to be applied over the next two years in the collection of material and in the mounting and maintenance of banks of data .
According to Dr. Zago , there will also be space for collaborators - especially pathologists and epidemiologists - to whom will fall the task of the supervision of the medical diagnoses , statistical analyses and of the methods of accompanying the patients .

An extraordinary year for FAPESP
The final edition of the year 2000 ofPesquisa FAPESP brings , as a front cover report , a theme very close to the publications in economy journalism .
However , the entrance into the magazine of the question ofrisk capital linked to technological innovation is , in truth , another example of the diversity of the FAPESP initiatives to give an impulse to scientific and technological development in São Paulo .
It is an example of the open vision which made the year 2000 an exceptional one in the life of the Foundation , and which does not feel intimidated in its search to attract to the world of research partners who , in the not too distant past , would have merited anathema of the scientific community .
On the report , it is worth remembering that since the launch of the Program of Partnership for Innovative Technology ( PITE ) in1994 , and even more from the start of the Program of Innovative Technology in Small Businesses ( PIPE ) , begun in July of 1997 , FAPESP has developed a consistent effort to induce technological development , based on a fundamental axiom : the company is the place of excellence for innovative research .
Now , in looking to approximate risk capital with small entrepreneurs , the Foundation is trying to move one more step forward in the support which it offers for the businesses with projects supported through PIPE ( 129 actually ) for them to have commercial success in the market .
As is known , FAPESP finances two phases of these innovate projects : that of the research of the technical and commercial viability of the proposal , with a duration of up to six months and a budget of up to R $ 75,000.00 , and of the research of the innovation itself , with duration of up to 2 years and of a budget of up to R $ 300,000.00 .
The third phase , when the company should put its results on the market , cannot be financed by FAPESP , which , however , offers support so that the company looks for other sources of finance and consequently amplifies its chances of success .
Now , risk capital is emerging today as an alternative to capitalization , a type of temporary partner of the enterprise , capable of assisting it until it takes root in the market .
Meanwhile , the technological development policy which the Foundation is carrying out , is to look for it and present to it the entrepreneurs with projects in PIPE .
It is worth pointing out here , the noting of a small end of the year balance , which is the spirit which runs through the Foundation - in its search for new entrances and innovative exits which would give an impulse to Paulista development - only brought good fruit during 2000 , beginning with the conclusion of the sequencing of the genome ofXylella fastidiosa , in the month of January .
The success of this project resulted in a celebration , in receiving a prize , trophies and medals offered by the Governor Mário Covas to the 192 researchers who worked with determination to decipher the genome ofXylella ; guaranteeing an impressive recuperation of scientific research done in Brazil , within the specialized ranks , in the national and international press ; provoked in July the cover story ofNature , one of the most important scientific magazines in the world , and from there onwards , guaranteed an international look at Brazilian scientific production , which only three years ago , very few suspected would be possible .

The discoveries are multiplying
Recently concluded , the mapping of will begin Comparative genomics within the country , the quickest way to study genes
Carlos Fioravanti
Just before Christmas eve , the sequencing of the genome ofXanthomonas citri , the bacteria which causes citric cancer , an old and serious problem in the citricultural world , was completed .
For the period over which it was done , only fourteen months , this work was proof of the maturing of the work methods and of the team itself - in a large part , the same that had participated this year in the mounting of the genomes of other bacteriaXylella fastidiosa , which provokes Citrus Variegated Clorose ( CVC ) or yellowing , another pest of the orange tree and that of the sugar cane .
The project ofXanthomonas will also inaugurate within the country comparative genomics : it begins by putting side by side the genetic material of the micro organisms , to discover how the genes work and to find means of reducing the agricultural loses .
Also well advanced , is the classification - or , as they say , the annotation - of the estimated 4,500 genes which make up the single chromsome ofXanthomonas the second phytopathogen mapped in Brazil and one of the first in the world .
Of the total , 593 genes are associated with metabolic processes of the production of energy , 365 in the synthesis of amino acids and other molecules which help in the working of enzymes , 486 in the formation of macro molecules ( proteins , carbohydrates and lipids ) , 310 in cellular processes ( the transport of substances , the division of cells and mobility ) and 292 are related to the pathogenics , virulence and adaptation of the bacteria .
At the end of November , there were still 1,530 in the category of hypothetical i.e. of uncertain function .
This final stage could finish at the same time as the conclusion of the mounting of the basic skeleton , with large pieces of the genome of the other bacteria which begun to be mapped in September : theXanthomonas campestris , very similar to that which has just finished being recognized .
The researchers believe that , perhaps in March , they will already have the detailed genome.The
group has gained experience .
TheXylella was entirely mapped by way of DNA plasmids - sequences of DNA which carry and multiply parts of the genome which is being studied .
One of the researchers , Anete Pereira de Souza , of Unicamp , went to Heidelberg in Germany to learn how to make the so called library of DNA plasmids , the primary material for the sequencing of the genome which represents the entire chromosome .
WithXanthomonas it was different .
In the 11 sequencing laboratories - spread over the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , the State Paulista University ( Unesp ) and Unicamp , under the coordination of two centers , one in the Faculty Agrarian and Veterinary Sciences ( FCAV ) in Unesp at Jaboticabal and the other in the Chemistry Institute of USP - firstly a scaffold was made - a virtual map or skeleton of the genome .
The framework was mounted with close to 2,000 DNA plasmids , each one with 35,000 to 50,000 pairs of bases of nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , guanine and thymine ) .
The two points of each DNA plasmid were mapped , in such a way that afterwards they could be fitted in and gave a general vision of the genome .
A more detailed vision came about as soon as the method of the shotguns was applied - smaller clones of between 1,500 and 3,00 pairs of bases , literally fired over the genome , which superimposed themselves entirely over it , reproducing its structure .
Since August of last year , when the work began , the researchers have produced 205,000 shotguns , whose processes of mounting were known since theXylella bacteria .
The novelty is that this time the DNA plasmids as well were made entirely in Brazil .
Luiz Roberto Furlan , a researcher at the central laboratory of the genome of Unesp in Jaboticabal , will not for a long time forget the day on which the coordinators of the project gave him the task of constructing the library of DNA plasmids .
Dr. Furlan , better known since the time of his student days as Cedral , because of the town in the Paulista interior where he was born , knew the importance of the mission , but didn 't have the least idea as to how to carry it out .
In resume : two months later , Cedral had recreated the methodology and was an expert in handling the vector Lawrist , a piece of circular DNA which incorporates fragments of the genome .
" I didn 't believe it when the first DNA plasmid came out right . "
he said " I thought I had done something wrong . " Another
difference is that the Bioinformatic Laboratory of Unicamp centralized the analysis of the genome , but was able to count on the reinforcement of two centers of bioinformatics created in Jaboticabal and at USP .
It was , in this way , much easier thoughXanthomonas had a genome with 5.2 million pares of bases , the double of that ofXylella .
To it were dedicated 51 researchers , a discrete group when compared with the 207 ofXylella and the 140 of the sugar cane genome .
Up until now , including the sequencing of thecampestris , there has been an investment of US $ 2.2 million , less than half of the allocation of US $ 5.4 million destined by FAPESP .
Nicknames
The tranquility with which the researchers have been working can be seen in the nickname with which they have been treatingXanthomonas on a day to day basis - simply it was Xanthô .
team lived through difficult moments at the end of May of this year , when the skeleton of the genome was ready .
It had 95 parts .
The problem was that they didn 't fit together directly .
Nothing to despair about for one of the coordinators of the project , Ana Claudia Rasera da Silva , of the Chemical Institute of USP .
Since the age of ten she has spent entire days on the carpet of the front room of her house mounting jig saw puzzles of 2 or 3 thousand pieces , such as one of a medieval castle surrounded by flowers which decorates her laboratory .
For her the genome is " only a little larger jig saw puzzle with millions of pieces . "
Ana Claudia guarantees that , in spite of the impasses , she doesn 't lose her patience nor her sense of humor at any time .
On the screen of the computer , the known fragments extend in straight lines and are often parallel because of the common parts .
Between them there are close to 30 blank areas , without any information .
Formally , they shouldn 't exist : the thousands of shotguns fired over the genome would appear to be sufficient as to not leave any fragment undiscovered .
Precious repetitions
A number of weeks passed before Ana Claudia and Meidanis managed to outline the problem : the blank areas were , in truth , repeated fragments - and the computer didn 't know what to do with them .
In order to understand what were these repetitions , Ana Claudia , with the help of Dr. Marcelo Trindade and of professor Shaker Chuk Farah , both also from the Chemical Institute of USP , took up some artesian work : they eliminated the repeated parts and the pieces fell into place .
With time , they came to see that in them were the most gratifying characteristics - and , if we have been able to tell the story of the researchers correctly , the most dazzling - of the genome ofXanthomonas .
Half of the repetitions were transposons - the jumping genes which jump from one point to another of the chromosome or even from one chromosome to another .
They appear to be capable of inducing their neighbors to express themselves or to make other genes inactive .
The team of Marie-Anne Van Sluys , of the Institute of Biosciences of USP , have already identified 51 of them .
One of them is Xatn1 ( informally calledxatinho 1 [ nuisance 1 ] ) , which repeats itself 18 times in the genome ; thexatinho 2 , repeats only five times .
According to Marie-Anne , there are strong indications that anotherxatinho could have come from another bacteria , Pseudomonas , by way of a mechanism called horizontal transference of genes , which occurs between different species .
It was difficult to discover that the other halfof the repetitions - also elucidated by way of DNA plasmids - were the secondary structures of DNA .
They form loops which work like clips , and more seriously , impede an enzyme , polymerase , slipping along the molecule and characterizes it : that is when the areas without any information come about .
In six months of work , the researchers managed to unwind the majority of the loops .
At the end of November there were only two missing which put back for some weeks the celebration of the conclusion of the genome .
With almost allof the problems resolved , the researchers now want to understand the specific mechanisms which might explain , for example , why theXanthomonas citri causes citric cancer and theX .
campestris , very similar , attacks cabbages .
Another doubt : how many bacteria of the same species can there be ?
The first comparisons indicate that there are high similarities in the genes , though the organization of them is very different .
Evolution dilemma
Another close relative , theX .
albilineans , that the teams from Jaboticabal and S ? o Paulo pretend to sequence next year , is slow to reproduce , something likeXylella , and only lives in the xylem of the sugar cane .
Biologically speaking , it has more in common with thecitri .
It is thought that it might be the link between the two species .
The comparisons ofXylella withXanthomonas have already begun .
The amino acid sequences - the molecules which form the proteins - of both are very similar .
The first is , let us say , more good looking .
It almost doesn 't have transposons and loops , for example .
" No matter what , both the organisms had a common ancestor , " said Sergio Russo Matioli , a specialist in evolution of the Institute of Biosciences of USP .
" If we were to have evidence that the genome of their ancestor had been the size ofXanthomonas , then there would have been a shrinking ofXylella , should it have been the contrary , then there was an amplification forXanthomonas . "
However , if the original species had had a genome of intermediary size , it could both have increased in the genome of the lineage which originatedXanthomonas and diminished in the lineage which producedXylella .
This field of evolution runs into the difficulty of finding registered fossils of bacteria .
Even then , the sequencing of the complete genomes has helped enormously in the understanding of evolutionary curiosities .
Some time ago , for example , when the sequencing ofEscherichia coli was completed , the bacteria used as a model for genetic and biochemical studies , something extraordinary was found : half of the genome had an unknown function .
The idea that this part of the genome could be involved in activities outside of the plate of Petri , on which the researchers put the organisms which they wishes to study , quickly gained adherence .
For this reason Matioli remembers that " If this hypothesis had been correct , then only studies which take into consideration the natural environment could clear up the function of all the genes of the micro organisms .
Differences
Ana Claudia confesses : " The genome ofXanthomonas is more sophisticated .. "
One of the arguments is that theXanthomonas has a density of bases of guanine and cytosine considerably higher ( 65 % ) .
InXylella it is of 53 % .
Consequently , the DNA of the former is more stable , but as well it is more difficult to beinterpreted by the enzyme polymerase - for this reason it is difficult to find , understand and take apart the loops .
Even at that it is a polemic point .
From his point of view , the familiarity which one has with each organism weighs heavily .
OfXylella , he remembered " we understood almost nothing , " whereas theXanthomonas was reasonably well understood , including with some genes already described .
It depends on the insects , the cigarrinhas , to spread them and to survive in the insect itself or in the sap juice of the conducting ducts of plants like the orange tree or the grape vine .
It is tempting , though risky , to say that theXanthomonas lives under better conditions : it reproduces more quickly , every two days and it is a free living bacteria : it spreads through the air , through the water and through the soil .
Important in this process are the genes avr ( of virulence , responsible for the pathogenesicity ) .
There are four copies of them in the two cytoplasts - circular DNAs , a lot smaller than the chromosome .
The vegetable cell only actions the defense mechanism if it recognizes the proteins generated by theavr .
However , what appears to happen is that theXanthomonas manages to trick the alert mechanisms , infiltrating itself and carries out the conquest of the host cell .
Close to 20 proteins participate in the process of infection , the so called secretion system type 3 , nonexistent inXylella .
There is also working in the team the Canadian researcher Shaker Farah , who estimates that there are between 50 and 80 proteins involved in the pathogenesicity - the development of citric cancer .
The doubts add to the conquests .
After the initial fright , appraised Cedral " There was a notable scientific growth within the team . "
The laboratory of Unesp at Jaboticabal , for example , prepared itself to produce stocks of DNA , now of all types - shotguns , DNA plasmids or even larger clones , used in the study of the human genome - for other institutions .
They could now only think on providinga service as the methods of work have changed enormously .
At Jaboticabal , the selection of the colonies with the clones - before done by hand using toothpicks - are today done by a robot endowed with a selection of needles which it itself cleans and sterilizes .
The robot can make between 80 and 100 plates each with 96 holes in four hours .
Manually the same task would have taken an entire day for eight or ten people .
Prospects
In the laboratories dedicated to the genome project in the State of São Paulo , gaining favor is the idea of maximum possible automation in the sequencing for the team to subject themselves only to the analysis of the results .
A goal which is apparently viable : in theXylella the sequencing was still very laborious , with many manual stages , but with the new machines it is possible to put the DNA in place for sequencing in the morning and to obtain the results in the late afternoon .
It could be here - in the work to attribute functions to the genes - that is the strength of the Brazilian team .
Something similar occurred some years ago in Formula 1 racing : intuitive and audacious Brazilian drivers won races in cars made in other countries .

A high level of homocystiene raises the risk of an unstable angina
The link between an excess of homocysteine in the circulation of the blood and heart problems is not news .
This amino acid , which forms itself in the organism due to the ingestion of proteins , is the theme of many articles and controversies throughout the international scientific world , but up until now there has been no research done on the blood levels in the Brazilian population .
The ProjectThe Determination of the Levels of Plasmatic Homocysteine in the Population of São Paulo - the Homocysteine as a Risk Factor for Cardiovascular Illnesses will fill this gap : it proves that high levels of homocysteine increase by at least 42 % the risk of unstable angina , a cardiac problem which can repeat itself various times .
Diet and vitamins
The good news is that , once identified the excess of homocysteine in the blood , this level can be brought down by way of a controlled diet or , if necessary , of vitamin supplements prescribed through a doctor .
At the moment , the examination for homocysteine is carried out by few Brazilian laboratories .
The biologist Vania D 'Almeida , responsible for the project , alerts that it is not recommended to take the examination without it first being suggested by a doctor , and , much less , to take the vitamin supplements since other illnesses could increase the level of homocysteine and automedication could hide the symptoms .
As well as this , though the Brazilian studies as yet do not point to a high level of homcysteine as a power force of other risk factors , it is fitting to remember that cigarettes , hypertension and high levels of cholesterol and of triglycerines greatly increase the possibilities of vascular illnesses .
Vania works at the Center of Genetic Medicine of the Departments of Pediatrics and Morphology of the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) , where she coordinates the Laboratory of Innate Errors of Metabolism .
Over time , the child could develop sight problems , mental retardedness and even suffer vascular accidents .
Vania added : " They are highly subject to thrombus embolism of a general form , and we found in the referential scientific literature deaths , sometimes at between 8 and 10 years of age , due to the a cardiovascular situation similar to that of the elderly . " Intrigued
by these precocious problems , an American researcher began to investigate the possibility of homocysteine being responsible for cardiovascular problems in general .
" He studied patients with cardiovascular illnesses such as the clogging of myocardium and angina in patients 35 years of age and older , and measured the level of homocysteine in their blood .
From that point onwards , the correlation between the high level of homocysteine and cardiovascular illnesses was in a certain way established . "
Worldwide
Vania said that her motivation was , as well as the large number of patients , the lack of data about the Brazilian population .
Homocysteine is closely linked to diet .
Statistics show that Japan is the country with the lowest indices of deaths from heart disease , whilst the United States has one of the highest indices .
" A question became important : could it be that the Brazilian patients with cardiovascular illnesses also have an alteration in their levels of homocysteine ?
In the future , to work with those who have cardiovascular illnesses , it will be necessary to answer this question . "
results of the research came from the analysis of blood samples of 115 patients with cardiovascular illnesses and from 129 healthy people , who were used as a control group .
The samples were taken at the Cardiology UTI of the São Paulo Hospital of Unifesp , and from patients of the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital of Recife ( PE ) .
The healthy volunteers were people who were attended at the clinics or employees of the institutions .
The research , done with the help of students , researchers and professors of Unifesp and of the Federal University of Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , confirmed a risk 4.9 times higher of an increase of homocysteine in the patients with a cardiovascular illness than with the control group .
The highest values were found in the age group between 31 and 40 years .
When the healthy individuals only were considered , the lowest level was the children between 8 and 12 years of age , and the highest , those of the age group above 60 years .
Both in the patients and in the control group , males showed indices higher than females .
High risk
Another confirmation was that of the higher probability of people with a certain mutation in the gene of the enzyme MTHFR ( methylene tetra-hydropholate redutase ) who had increased levels of homocysteine .
The mutation is known as C677T : it occurs on the nucleotide 677 of this gene by way of the substitution of a cytosine ( C ) for a thymine ( T ) .
As the chromosomes exist in pairs ( except the sexual chromosomes ) , certain people could have this mutation on both the genes of a pair of chromosomes .
Consequently , people who are TT are more susceptible to an increase in homocysteine .
It was also concluded that the risk of unstable angina was increased in at least 42 % when the level of homocysteine went above the value considered normal world-wide , according to many international references : 15 micromoles per liter .
A diet rich in vitamin B6 , B12 and folic acid , helps to reduce the level of homocysteine .
A slice of liver is an excellent source of these nutrients .
Banana and beans are also sources of vitamin B6 and folic acid , whilst cow 's milk provides vitamin B12 .
These vitamins are necessary for the correct working of the metabolic process of methionine , an essential amino acid , present principally in proteins of animal origin which we swallow .
The organism need to take from methionine the methyl group , important in various functions such as the synthesis of DNA , transcription and the formation of proteins , and for this it transforms methionine into homocysteine which in high levels becomes a toxic product which has to be eliminated .
The elimination has the help of vitamin B6 which participates in the transformation of part of the homocysteine into cystationine ( an intermediary compound between homocysteine and cysteine ) .
When the cysteine is formed , part of it goes to make up peptides ( such as glutathione , an important antioxidant ) and proteins and part of their derivatives and excreted in urine .
Arteriosclerosis
Everything would be resolved satisfactorily if it wasn 't for the fact that part of the homocysteine transforms itself into homcysteine thiolactone , an intermediary more reactive than homocysteine itself and which reacts above all with lipoprotein of low density , LDL , known as the evil cholesterol .
This reaction forms chemical groupings which obstruct the blood vessels and provoke arteriosclerosis .
However , it is possible to have a happy ending : part of homocysteine thiolactone can return to the form of homocysteine and this , with the help of folic acid and vitamin B12 , can add in methyl again and go back to be methionine - a process called remethylation .
As we are accustomed to swallowing less methionine than our organism needs , the remethylation is a very useful metabolic pathway .
Nevertheless , the work of the biologist from Unifesp serves as an important general alert and a worthwhile contribution towards the prevention of cardiovascular illnesses in Brazil and in the world .

Conductor polymers under control
Brazilians dominate the new area of materials technology which gained the Nobel chemistry prize in 2000
Brazilian scientists already dominate one of the most promising areas of materials technology : that of conductor and semi-conductor polymers , also called synthetic metals .
These plastics which conduct electricity - and whose discovery resulted in the Nobel chemistry prize of 2000 for three scientists - are destined to turn into one of the principal prime material of the components of equipment and electronic gadgets .
To disclose their potential , a group of researchers worked on the thematic projectPolyanilin and Poly ( p-Phenylene Vinylene ) as Active Elements of Electronic Devices and Optoelectronics , financed by FAPESP .
MacDiarmid , with whom Dr. Faria jointly published work - , dominates from the synthesis of these electronic polymers until the manufacture of appliances ( transistors , light emission diodes , etc . ) , passing to the technology of the production and characterization of ultrafine organic films .
Among the possible applications of these products is the manufacture of flat screens for televisions and monitors , in substitution of the century old cathode ray tube , and the use of these organic products in medicine .
Chemistry changes physics
Until the middle of the 70s , nobody would have heard it said that any organic compound was capable of being a good conductor of electricity .
The discovery which rocked the concept of the tight world of material physics came from a chemical laboratory .
The discovery happened by accident .
The Chinese assistant of Dr. Shirakawa carried out a synthesis of polyacetylene , a simple polymer formed from carbon and hydrogen .
Since he didn 't understand very well the Japanese of his boss , he ended up making a mistake while following the recipe given by Dr. Shirakawa .
Instead of the expected result - an infusible powder - the assistant produced a strange polymeric film .
Intrigued by that material with a metallic shine , Dr. Shirakawa decided to carefully guard it .
Sometime later , he didn 't hesitate to show it to Dr. MacDiarmid , who was passing through Japan .
There began a partnership which would result in a new line of research , followed today in many countries .
At the invitation of Dr. MacDiarmid , Dr. Shirakawa went to Pennsylvania and both , joined by Dr. Heeger , began to investigate the physical - chemical properties of polyacetylene .
Chemical doping
On disclosing the mystery of that film , they came up against a new technique , capable of transforming a material , originally an insulator , into an excellent conductor of electricity .
Known as chemical doping , this technique is very simple : molecules of acid - called doping molecules - are injected into the polymer and exchange electrical charges with the molecules of the polymer .
For many years the conducting polymers have been attracting scientists , who quickly found applications .
The first of them was the lining of an aircraft invisible to radar - the North American fighter aircraft F-117 Stealth , used in the Gulf War .
Another was the blinding of electronic equipment .
Contrary to what one might think , it was not the high conductivity but the properties of semi conductivity - obtained through the interruption of the process of doping right at the initial stage - which augment the market potential of these polymers .
For their optoelectronic properties - conduct electricity and as well emit light if stimulated by an electric current or luminous radiation - , they promise to be the stars of electronics of the 21st century .
The major objective is , with the support of a technology company , to implant a prototype of a production line of the devices available within the laboratories involved .
The researchers already have control of all of the processes of synthesis and manufacture of the ultra thin polymer films .
Another stage of the research , coordinated by Dr. Adnei Andrade , is in the micro electronic laboratory of the Polytechnic school : part of the preparation and characteristics of the devices with transistors , diodes and solar cells .
The project has three stages .
The first is the production of the films , which begins with the synthesis of the polymers coordinated by the chemist Dr. Debora Tereza Balogh .
She works with the basic polymer polyparaphenylene , which is submitted to the chemical reactions needed to turn it more or less into a conductor .
Also it is through the chemical substitutions that it acquires various colors , depending on the choice of the lateral groups of the chains .
Diluted in solvent in a test tube , the primary material already shows a beautiful luminous effect : one only needs to switch on a light or pass an electric current for the liquid to shine like a lamp .
This happens because the structure of the polymeric semiconductor materials contain " centers " where the carriers , positives and negatives , stay " localized . "
In these " centers " there is a recombination between the negative carriers ( electrons ) and the positive carriers ( holes ) , in a process called electronic transition .
This transition results in the liberation of energy in the form of light .
Very fine and aseptic
After synthesis comes the preparation of the film .
There are various methods for this .
In the laboratories of GPBG there are methods available from the production of films with disordinated structures to those whose structure has a high degree of molecular order .
The most sophisticated is the Langmuir-Blodgett method , which allows the making of films with a thickness of a molecular layer - that is , of a few nanomters or millionths of a millimeter .
This monomolecular thickness is already sufficient to confer on the material the optoelectronic properties desired .
Though the work requires expensive state of the art equipment - a Langmuir-Blodgett cube with its accessories can cost US $ 60,000 - , the production follows a simple principle .
In contact with the water , the diluted polymer spreads along the surface in a fine film like oil in suspension .
The equipment permits the control of all the conditions necessary for the formation of the film , as well as its dimensions .
Then the film is transferred to a substrate - a glass sheet or other material which permits perfect adhesion - a condition essential for the next steps .
To be correct , this delicate operation has to be done in a totally controlled atmosphere .
If it wasn 't for the equipment , the " clean room " as the laboratory is called , could be confused for a surgical center .
For this reason , the scientists work completed covered , with overall , hood , mascara and slippers .
Examinations and products
The films produced them pass through a battery of examinations .
The molecular structure is characterized in the microscope laboratory of GPBG , equipped with an electronic microscope ( SEM ) and of atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , which have a resolution of 0.1 nanometer .
Also optical studies of the material are carried out , coordinated by a specialist in photo luminosity Dr. Francisco E .
G .
Guimarães , and then a check on its magnetic properties at the laboratory of Dr. Carlos F .
O .
Graeff , in the faculty of Philosophy , Science and Letters of Ribeirão Preto .
Finally , the film is ready for use in the production of the devices which are carried out in collaboration with the Polytechnic school , where the physicist Dr. Adnei Andrade coordinates the work .
A specialist in electrical engineering with published works in international magazines , Dr. Andrade has already constructed various light emission devices ( LEDs ) , transistors for field effects and photovoltaic diodes .
The development of these devices helps the researchers to better understand the electronic mechanics involved , so that they may be improved .
However , this know-how , principally for the construction of displays , has a large chance of becoming a commercial product , assured Dr. Andrade .
Many publications
Over the last five years , the GPBG produced close to 50 international articles on polymer conductors and semi-conductors , as well as papers in congresses and symposiums .
At the lastInternational Conference on Science and Technology of Synthetic Metals , which took place in July in the Austrian city of Badgastein , close to 30 of the 1,000 papers presented were Brazilian and of those almost 20 were from GPBG .
" Brazil no longer passes unnoticed on the international scientific stage . "
So much so that at one of these conferences almost ten years ago , a close collaboration was formed between GPBG and Dr. MacDiarmid .
The first visit of Dr. Faria to the University of Pennsylvania in 1990 , was fundamental for the partnership which resulted in the publication of various works .
Directly orientated by Dr. MacDiarmid , the at that time student Luiz Mattoso brought to Brazil the method of synthesis of polyanilins , which would substitute with advantages the polymers used until that time .
More stable when in contact with the environment , the polyanilins are more easily synthesized and processed .
On the visit which Dr. MacDiarmid made to the laboratories of IFSC , Dr. Faria confirmed the impression which he had of the scientist : " A man with energy and a capacity for work beyond the norm .

Smaller TVs and computers
The researchers of GPBG highlight lots of applications for semi conductor polymers .
As they are capable of converting electricity without generating heat - the so called cold light - , they are ideal for luminous warning devices such as the so called LEDs ( light emitting diodes ) used in the instrument panels of cars for example .
Another field of application is in paints : in the place of common polymer resins , the paints would have luminescent resins , for example .
" In this way , you could obtain a painted wall which emits light . "
added the researcher.Malleable , the polymers could be injected , blown or used as a coating in the form of skins or ultra fine films , which is indeed the focus of the research of GPBG .
These films are also being studied for the manufacture of flat television screens , which permit the transformation of the equipment into a type of picture which would hang from the wall .
There are still obstacles towards making these televisions commercially viable : the definition and the speed of the image , but Dr. Faria remembers that large companies within the sector are investing in research to overcome this .
An example is Dupont , one of the largest in the area of polymers , who bought over Uniax - a company created by Dr. Heeger through the University of Santa Barbara - to produce LEDs and flat screens .
Philips as well is buying a company generated through the University of Cambridge ( England ) and Sony is investing in products originating from the University of Nagoia ( Japan ) .
As an extension to this , computers as well should become a lot smaller in size and cheaper : the flat screens should decrease the price of the monitors , which today compose close to 50 % of the cost of a micro .
Even the laptops will be perfected , with the elimination of the inconvenient fact of the emission of direct light , which makes the image go out of focus depending on the angle of vision .
Another important application are the visors or displays , such as those of the cellular phone .
As well , medicine has already predicted important advances based on these polymers , which could be used for the manufacture of implants such as pace makers or in the reconstitution of muscles which have lost their capacity of movement .

Young , good-looking and with the weight of a bull
The Superprecocious Yearling is ready for slaughter at one year of age and with 450 kg of weight , which guarantees soft meat and profits to the cattlemen
Otto Filgueiras
A system for the raising of cattle developed at the State Paulista University ( Unesp ) , in Botucatu , brings an innovative solution to the national cattle raising industry .
With one year of age , with weight of more or less 450 kilograms and without the use of anabolic steroids , the bullock is ready for slaughter , contrary to the majority of national cattle which require three to four years to arrive at this weight .
The new technique of controlling - the manner of rearing and feeding - has resulted in the Superprecocious Yearling .
It always reaches the 3 millimeter mark , permitting freezing in the cold storage plant which does not prejudice its softness .
In reality , this meat will not be recommended for barbecues .
advised professor Antonio Carlos Silveira , coordinator of the thematic project theDevelopment of Meat Cattle of the Superprecocious Biological Model , under development since 1992 on the Lageado campus of Unesp , with financial support from FAPESP .
Dr. Silveira coordinates a group of 28 people involved in the project , which includes 11 subprojects and will be concluded in 2003 .
There are 12 researchers from various centers : The Faculty of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences ( FCAV ) of Unesp at Jaboticabal , the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) in Ribeirão Preto , the Higher School of Agriculture Luiz de Queiroz of USP in Piracicaba and the Institute of Biosciences of Unesp at Botucatu .
There is also the participation of 11 post-graduate and graduate students of Unesp at Botucatu .
Jumping stages
The Superprecocious Yearling is a result of the breeding of the Nelore breed of cattle , of Indian origin , with European breeds - Aberdeen Angus , Hereford , Simental , Braunvieh , Charolês , Limousin , Swiss Brown and others .
The cross breeding can be done naturally or by artificial insemination .
The system is notable because it jumps stages .
For example , there is the need for only 35 % of the pasture area used in traditional cattle rearing , because the calves stop breast feeding at seven months and with 230 kg - an age at which they would normally weigh 200 kg - and go directly to fattening in confinement .
The Spuerprecocious Yearling is crossed with a bull of European extraction and the offspring has a quarter of the Nelore blood ( from the first cross ) and three quarters of European blood .
With the passing on of the technology to other farms and ranches , and with proven success , the system is already consolidated .
It began to be developed in 1992 , in a partnership between Unesp of Botucatu and the agriculture and cattle raising company Nomurabras , situated in Araxa ( MG ) , which , at the initial stage , gave the calves and a property in the municipality .
" Right from the first months of the experiments , the slaughter age of the bullocks was lowered by a year and the first parturition of the cows to a minimum of 24 months . " he completed .
Biological model
To make sure that everything runs well , the researchers monitor the growth of the muscular skeleton structure of the yearlings from their birth until they stop breast feeding , and from there until their termination - mature enough for slaughter .
They also research the quality of the feedstock and supplements , to guide the control of food .
Also , in the area of molecular biology , they carry out the characterization of the genes involved in the growth and in the composition of the carcass , to identify genetically superior individuals and eventually destine them for reproduction .
No other country has a biological model for beef cattle as efficient and quick , assured Dr. Silveira .
He pointed out the research into the process of the softness of the meat : " The enzyme calpastatine which inhibits the softness , is present in all animals , it is only that some have more and some have less . "
For example , in the Zebuin breeds - such as Nelore - it is more frequent .
The group is also developing a methodology to study the characteristics of the carcass of the breeds in relation to the polymorphism of the growth hormone ( IGF-1 ) and leptine - a product of the obesity gene - highlighting the degree of its presence .
The characteristics of the meat and the degree of marmorizing - presence of fat in the carcass - depend on the genetic inheritance of the animal .
Tropical genetics
Predominant in Brazil , the Nelore does not have sexual or terminal precocity , but demonstrates an enormous rusticity and adaptation to the tropical climate and to precarious feeding , while the European animal is sexually precocious and develops in a lot less time , but gets huffy about the restricted food imposed by the climate .
The crossing of the Nelore and the European results in half-cast offspring genetically superior to their parents - a phenomena known as heterosis - , in which the rustic characteristics of the Nelore combine with the sexual precocity and the rapid growth rate of the European cattle .
The female Nelore , however , doesn 't have enough milk for the nutritional demands needed for the half-breed calf .
From birth to puberty , the growth hormones are liberated to develop bone and muscle and for this the calves need a supplementary supply of milk , rich in amino acids , vitamins and minerals .
This supplement or ration is provided via the system , calledcreep feeding , in pre-molded troughs .
They are positioned in places in the pasture where only the still breast feeding calves can have access .
The cows can 't manage to reach the troughs .
In this way , the calves who normally stop breast feeding at seven months with a weight of 200 kg obtain 30 to 45 extra kilos of weight .
On a property of 1,000 hectares where normally one would raise 1,000 animals per year , only 350 hectares are occupied using the system Superprecocious Yearling because the calves don 't stay more that 7 months in the fields with their mothers , whereas in the traditional system the creation time takes 37 months .
As there no longer exists areas of creation , more pasture is left over and the property is optimized : there can be double or even triple the production of cattle or the extra hectares can be used for agriculture .
In this way the animals enter into a phase of fattening in the field or in confinement even before they reach the age of puberty - when the production of steroid hormones predominates over sexual hormones .
At this stage , the female enters the puberty cycle and the male increases its scrotal circumference and begins the deposition of fat .
The females of the cross breeds already begin their first cycle at 12 months , while the males at the same age weigh more or less 450 kg and can be slaughtered .
Reinforced feeding
The bacteria which are found in the rumen - part of the stomach of ruminants - extract energy from the foodstuffs consumed using up totally the starch of the cereals and liberating volatile fatty acids .
These gases are absorbed by the Yearling and correspondto 85 % or more of the energy which he needs .
For this reason , and as the starch in the corn grain is covered with a protective covering ( endosperm ) which the bacteria need to break down to make use of the energy , the researchers decided to accelerate the process .
To this end , the corn is collected when it is more humid and placed in silos .
In this way the protective covering of the jacket is broken and increases the availability of the starch to the bacteria .
This material , endowed with the characteristics of a corn meal cake , substitutes the corn ground into the ration .
The result is an economy of 20 % in the cost of the fattening of the yearlings when in confinement , since the humid corn is more digestible and it doesn 't have to be stored , dried and put into sacks - it goes straight to the silo .
It is the so called silage of the humid corn grain .
As well as this , as it is collected almost a month before normal , as it needs to have 26 % humidity , there is a lessening of the risk of loss by the attack of predators .
Cost reduction
However , the heavier the animal , the greater the amount of food needed for maintenance , and less foodstuff is left over for the food conversion which makes the animal gain weight .
For example , an animal of 300 kg needs 9 kg of dry material per day to gain 1 kg of weight to eventually arrive at 450 kg .
However , the Superprecocious Yearling passes from 230 kg to 450 kg eating on average 6 kg of dry material per day , and it is sufficient to gain 1 kg per day .
As well as this , the younger animal of whatever breed proportionally gives more beef and with a greater softness .
Slaughtered with more or less 450 kg , the yearling gives 16 arrobas ( 240 kg ) of meat with the minimum 3 millimeters of protective fat on the carcass .
Before slaughtering , the fat cover and the area of the loin are checked by ultrasound .
When the thickness of the fat is less than that required the meat " burns " and hardens when it is refrigerated , as well as losing in conservation , softness and color .
As well , there is no need to overstep the limit - 3 to 4 millimeters - as this would be uneconomical : Dr. Silveira remembered that the North Americans have the habit of eating meat with between 8 and 10 millimeters of fat and for this reason their production costs and that of confinement are much higher .
An experimental slaughterhouse
At the moment the yearlings are slaughtered in the slaughterhouses of the region , but the researchers pretend to construct an experimental slaughterhouse on the campus at Lageado with the capacity of slaughtering eight animals per day .
It will be useful to the faculty laboratory , also reformed during the project , which is investigating the quality of the meat .
There , there is a check on the softness of the meat , the color , pH and other items .
" Our expectation , " stated Dr. Silveira " is to build in Unesp , at Botucatu , the largest research center for meat quality in the country . "
The final idea is to establish a certificate of quality which facilitates the exportation of Brazilian meat .
For Dr. Silveira , the country could be a major exporter of meat if it was to present a product which was softer and had a certificate of guarantee .
He is hoping that , within a period of three years , the laboratory can issue a meat certificate - specifying if the meat is from a male or female , how much fat there is and what is its degree of softness , as well as presenting a breakdown of the food the animal was fed on - which will confer a guarantee certified by the university .
There are sub projects being developed to attain this objective .
Guaranteed maturation
It is also important for the perfecting of the quality of the meat , the adoption of a maturation technique - which , in Botucatu , is done within the laboratory .
The cuts are vacuum packed and placed in a refrigerator at a temperature of between 0 and 2 degrees Celsius for 14 to 20 days .
During this period the meat becomes darker and afterwards , when oxygenated , returns to its cherry red , said Dr. Luis Arthur Loyola Chardulo , professor of the Chemical and Biochemical Department of the Institute of Biosciences of Unesp .
He is responsible for the evaluation of the quality of the meat and for the coordination of the biochemical research , together with Dr. Roberto Roa , of the Department of Technology of Foodstuffs of Unesp at Botucatu .
They check the level of proteins , fat , minerals , humidity , pH and carry out the microbiological analysis for tests of contamination by salmonella and for the activity of enzymes .
To complete these studies , they are evaluating the effects of the manipulation of genetic factors - genetic and sexual markings by the method of the reaction in polymerase chain ( PCR ) - to identify and select the individuals with superior genetic value to include in the characteristics of the carcass .
With this project , the cattle ranchers are gaining a technique for an innovative control which will guarantee them a profit , develop the cattle business and point them towards exportation of meat on a very large scale .

An attack on wastage
Although there has occurred a modernization of Brazilian cattle raising during the last decade , the vast majority of the 150 million head of the national herd are still created extensively on the pasture of close to 4 million rural properties which exist within the country .
The average distribution is of one animal per hectare .
As well as this , of the 30 million head slaughtered last year , only 1.8 million were in the system of confinement - which signified a loss of the use of land which could be used for agriculture or even in a more efficient cattle ranch .
According to Dr. Silveira , the system of production of the Superprecocious Yearling guarantees the cattle raiser a profit calculated at R $ 163.70 per animal .
The total cost of production - including vaccines , medicine , price of the calf , rent of the pasture and food - comes to RS $ 457 .
As the income from the carcass is 55 % of the gross weight or 16.53 arrobas and the rancher receives from the slaughterhouse R $ 40.00 per arroba , the November 2000 price , he collects RS $ 661.20 per animal .
Since the Brazilian territory is very large and has diverse climates , the Superprecocious Yearling system , in order to have an all year round slaughtering system , is only suggested for regions where there is the availability of grain , such as the South , South West and Central West .
Consequently , in the North and North East it is better to produce the green cow - created on pasture - and to adopt an alternative system of precocious yearlings created only on pasture , which as well will guarantee an income .
For example , for calves which stop breast feeding at less than 230 kg , Dr. Silveira recommends a period of creation of eight months on pasture and four months in confinement , until their slaughter at 20 months with 476 kg hoof weight and 17.48 arrobas .
Even then , the profit of the rancher will be RS $ 228.93 per yearling , over a longer period of time .

Pozzolanas : the map of the mine
A survey locates precious rocks for the cement industry
After having traveled over 24,000 kilometers , in an effort which began in 1996 , a group of researchers from the Institute of Geosciences ( IG ) of the University of S ? o Paulo ( USP ) have just finished mapping the principal occurrences of Pozzolanas which exist in the State of S ? o Paulo .
This material , formed by rocks or clays , when incorporated into the process of the cement industry , provides a reduction in the production costs , caused less damage to the environment and brings technological advantages such as turning the product more resistant to the action of water .
To make use of these benefits , it only required that the industry of S ? o Paulo and of the South East region have a more detailed understanding of the locations of the Pozzolanas .
To know where they are contributes towards incorporating them into the traditional mixture which results in the manufacture of cement , a process invented and patented by the British stonemason Joseph Aspdin during the 19th century .
The name comes from its resemblance to the final product of a calciferous rock found in abundance on the isle of Portland in Great Britain .
The method consists of a mixture of 80 % of the calciferous rock with 20 % of clay , which , when submitted to high temperatures , transforms itself into clinker ( blocks of cement ) .
This product , after being ground into a powder , results in the so called Portland cement .
Pozzolanic Portland cement is that which in its composition allows for up to a 50 % addition of Pozzonala .
For its part , the name Pozzolanas comes from the volcanic rocks found in the region of Pozzuoli , close to Mount Vesuvius , in the south of Italy .
When mixed with quicklime and ground up , these rocks transform themselves into cement .
They were used considerably by the ancient Romans .
The cement used in the Coliseum in Rome has Pozzolanas in its composition .
Recently the term began to be applied as well to products which have a similar use .
For example , Pozzolanas are the acid slag of the steel mills , ashes from electric furnaces , rejects from the cracking of petroleum , the ashes of vegetable residues and sub products from the extraction of coal .
The research work namedThe Evaluation of the Geological Potential of Pozzolanic Material in the State of São Paulo , coordinated by professor Jorge Kazuo Yamamoto , of the Department of Sedimentary and Environmental Geology of the IG of USP , resulted in various maps and in the collection of 350 samples .
The researchers chose 60 of them to have their Pozzolanic activity analyzed and finally 32 to be tested within the laboratory .
" With the use of Pozzolanas in the manufacture of cement , the industry will reduce production costs .
We don 't have a percentage , because this will depend on the proximity or not of the deposits for each factory . "
As well as this , the work has appreciable scientific merit .
" Never before was there a mapping so extensive and rigorous on the occurrences of Pozzolanic material in the State of São Paulo , " declared the professor .
Resistance to time
In Brazil Pozzolanas are used principally in the South where the resulting ashes of the burning of coal in the thermoelectric power stations finish up in the mixture which produces cement , and in the North East where the mixture of cement includes calciferous clays .
In the South East , the very region of the country which produces the most cement , with 54.25 % of the total , the use of Pozzolanas is small , in spite of them having economic , technological , geological and environmental advantages in relation to pure clinker .
Or that is to say , with the passage of time , the concrete with Pozzolanas becomes less permeable and more compact than that produced by the use of common cement .
" The use of Pozzolanas in the construction of concrete dams is already renowned for its technological benefits of security and durability which it confers to the concrete . "
Another advantage of using pozzolanas is that of preserving the calciferous deposits , the principal component of common cement .
Calciferous rock is a product with many other applications such as the correction of the soil 's pH , the primary material for the production of quicklime and in the production of iron slag in the steel manufacturing industry .
For the environment , the use of pozzolanas reduces the emission of carbon dioxide .
The high temperature furnaces used in the roasting of limestone and clay for the production of Portland type cement are responsible for the liberation of enormous quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
" The adoption of pozzolanic cement is an excellent way to improve the quality and reduce the levels of pollution of the companies . "
High technology
The technological base for the use of pozzolanas is not a problem .
For the researchers , one of the motives for the low use of pozzolanas in the South East is the lack of knowledge of where they are located .
This problem has just been solved , in part , by the work of the team from IG .
The researchers concluded , in the first place , that the geological area with the highest possibility for the occurrence of the product in the State of S ? o Paulo is in the Basin of the river Parana .
There were also selected nine Paulista regions to receive special attention : Leme , Casa Branca , Aracatuba , Franca-Pedregulho , Piraju-Fartura , Assis , Pederneiras , Araraquara and Limeira-Rio Claro-Ipeuna-São Pedro .
When covering the diverse area of the State in search of pozzolanas , the researchers didn 't always have a smooth and tranquil experience .
At one time or another , they came up against a special type of Pozzolana , esponjilite .
Known popularly as monkey powder , esponjilite cause enormous attacks of itching , no matter how prudent one is when approaching the locations where they are accumulated .
However , to the relief of all , the uncomfortable esponjilite represent only a relatively small portion of these deposits .
Laboratory tests
The tests with the samples were carried out in the laboratories of ABCP .
The entity is an organization which represents 11 industrial groups , with 59 cement factories spread throughout Brazil .
" These two types were found in the largest quantities , and consequently present the highest possibility of being economically viable . "
The largest occurrence of basalt found by the researchers is in Alto Paranapanema , and that of clay in the Center - West of the State .
The details of the occurrences of pozzolanas will certainly contribute to the development of the cement industry in the State of S ? o Paulo .
The growth in the production of cement has been large over the last few years .
It grew from 25.8 million tons in 1990 to a forecast of40 million in 2000 .
Brazil is the sixth largest producer in the world , behind China , India , The United States , Japan and South Korea .
The largest Brazilian producer is the Votorantim Group with 41.7 % of the total .
The next places are taken by the Jo ? o Santos Group with 11.8 % , and Cimpor with 9.0 % .
The accompaniment of the production of cement is important , since it reveals the oscillations of the Brazilian economy .
Thecivil construction industry , the principal consumer of the product , is one of the first sectors to react when the country is doing well or doing poorly .
Over the last five years , the scenario was of a recession .
In 1999 , for example , the BIP of the sector fell 3.68 % .
With the return of growth , however , the situation changed and for 2000 it is hoped that there will be an increase in the BIP of 4 % and an increase of 6 % in the civil construction industry and in the production of cement .
For 2001 , the prospects are even better , since various construction projects of large scale of popular houses were announced over the last few months .
The heating up of civil construction is good news .
Not only because the sector absorbs semi-skilled workers who would be difficult to place in other areas of the economy , but because it drives forward the demand in other strategic sectors such as steel and glass .
In this field , the role of the pozzolanas could be very important , since they represent a viable alternative for the sustainable development of the cement industry .

X-rays controlled at a distance
The system of the control of quality on line , reduces the costs and the exposureof patients to radiation
The reduction of the exposure of the patients to x-rays and the decrease by 20 % in the cost of the radiological films are some of the results obtained with the control of quality on line of the diagnosis via images , implanted by the company Unidade Radiologica Paulista ( URP ) .
The principal improvements are the reduction of the loss of quality of the image and the elimination of unnecessary doses of radiation caused by the machine 's poor regulation .
Another advantage is the elimination of the operational technical visits to the clinic .
As yet at the pilot stage , this new process is a result of the projectDevelopment of a System of Remote Management for Programs of Guaranteed Quality in the Department of Diagnosis by Image , that the URP and the Technical Services of Medical-Hospital Appliances of the Institute of Electrotechnical and Energy of the University of São Paulo ( IEE-USP ) developed through the Program of Technological Innovation for Companies ( PITE ) of FAPESP .
The IEE has been working on the control of quality in the area of health since 1991 , when it worked in conjunction with the University Hospital of USP .
From that time onwards , it began to monitor the procedures of various companies : the technicians of IEE collect the data and afterwards analyze them in the laboratory .
In the area of radiodiagnostics , the new system will make the work of checking the data easier .
After concluding the pilot phase , the system will be available for all the clinics and hospitals who solicit the service .
Internet inspired
The URP , which has been working in this area for 40 years , approved of the program of IEE in 1993 .
He coordinates , together with the physicist Dr. Tânia Furquim and the engineer Dr. Elias Roma Neto , a team of 12 people including engineers , physicists and technicians , who are responsible for the communication network .
It is through this network that part of the data used in the evaluations of quality of a clinic is sent - various times per day over the Internet - to the central reception , storage and analysis center located in the IEE .
Once processed , the data passes for analysis to the physicists who emit the reports which are then placed at the disposition of the clients on the site of the IEE ( www.iee.usp.br ) .
In any case where they show a serious problem , the person responsible for the clinic receives an alert via e-mail or by telephone .
In this way it is possible to rapidly make the necessary corrections .
As well as this , a group of professionals of the IEE remain available for clearing up any doubts and indicating procedures .
In real time
" The important step in this project is to make viable the identification and solution to a problem in real time . " revealed the coordinator .
" The process of correction has become very quick . "
He related that the index of rejection - inadequate examination of a correct diagnosis - registered today by the clinics varies between 15 % and 20 % .
He remembered that the control of quality in clinics of radiodiagnosis is obligatory in the State of São Paulo since 1994 and in the country since 1998 .
Trustworthy examinations
To conclude the project there is the need to implant a system of the acquisition of the data for the remote control of the temperatures of the film processors and to automate the use of the pages on the Internet .
Today , the IEE has only carried out the remote accompaniment of one of the three units of URP in the capital , São Paulo .
" A poorly regulated machine is responsible for the increase in the occurrence of these cases in a clinic . "
Dr. Schwartz revealed that the URP manages to remain within the band of rejections of 5 % , recommended internationally .
As well as URP , 19 other Paulista radiodiagnostic clinics are clients of the IEE and they are still receiving visits from technicians : the system implanted by the IEE will be extended to them during the year 2001 .
Equipment
The financing by FAPESP was basically used for the importation of computer software and quality control equipment .
Among the apparatus , a digital server which remains at the IEE , receives all the data and automatically processes it .
In quality control , the outstanding piece of equipment is the sensitometer - a sensitometer determines and defines the characteristics of the radiological films , such as the velocity of the exposure and the contrast .
The URP received as well a computer terminal , a modem with an exclusive telephone line , which receives and sends all the data of the examinations , a data collector with a bar code reader , and eight electronic precision thermometers .
As well as evaluating the working of the equipment , the work system shows the professional level of the professionals involved in the process .
The software used in the program was developed by the IEE itself .
At the URP , the workers responsible for the service rooms , feed the reception terminal the data after each battery of examinations .
By way of an identity badge with a bar code , the person responsible for the source of the data is identified .
The URP carries out close to 4,800 examinations per month at the Paulista unit , where 40 of the 100 workers are involved in the project .
The cost of implementation of the system at URP was R $ 6,000.00 and its use " gave a proportional reduction of 15 % of the direct costs of our activity , " revealed Dr. Schwartz .
Broad band
The team from the IEE are thinking on further advances .
The expansion of the service of broad band telecommunications in Brazil , for example , will permit an evaluation of the image by the network .
Dr. Costa remembered another motive for the creation of the service : there is a lack of qualified personnel in the sector for one to be able to carry out the service within the companies .
" The number of students in the area of physics has been going down year by year in Brazil , since the difficulties encountered in the work market have finished up frightening away any interested youngsters . "
The researcher called attention to the fact that the remote quality control will permit a resolution of the problems of clinics which are distant from the large centers .

A blow to our vain pride
The sequencing of the human genome proves the scientific similarities between animals , plants and bacteria and gives weight to the idea that we are merely one more species on the Earth
Carlos Fioravanti and Marcos Pivetta
For a moment man felt small .
Exactly on the same day , the 12th of February , two groups that had been contending with each other for years for the right to finish quicker the sequencing of the complete human genome - the Public International Consortium and the private North American company Celera Genomics - broke , in a separate manner and in distinct publications , the same and surprising news .
After having mapped close to 95 % of the human genetic code , they estimate that man has close to 30,000 genes , three to four times less than what was previously imagined .
In the tangled data , analysis and opinions that beefed up the two initial blueprint of our genome , printed on the pages of the British magazineNature ( Public Consortium ) and of the North AmericanScience ( Celera ) , this number caught everyone 's eyes .
Only 30,000 genes !
The species which dominates the planet , that has been capable of planting its flag on the moon and of journey back to earth , houses in each cell a little more than double the number of genes of worms and flies .
The reaction of society was immediate .
General shock and jokes comparing Homo sapiens to small winged and crawling beings .
Then , would this be the main conclusion to one of the most talked about and costly scientific programs ever carried out by humanity ?
Beyond this discovery , the data on the genome shows that the genes are distributed in an irregular form through the 23 pairs of chromosomes which make up the human genome .
There are chromosomes with a higher concentration of genes and others with very few .
As well , the predominance of repeated sequences called junk DNA was noticed , whose function is still unknown .
For the time being , it is interpreted as evidence that our genetic code has incorporated sequences from other species ( bacteria for example ) and has still not gotten rid of this material of doubtful use .
The ending of a great scientific piece of work can frequently produce more doubts than certainties .
This was what happened with the human genome , disseminating an apparent effect - only apparent - opposite to what was initially expected .
From the moment that one analyses the two sketches of our DNA , a series of new , and old , questions come into play .
Some of them follow below .
One needs to be crystal clear : the mapping of the sequencing , although it made the pages ofNature and Science , is still only a sketch ( the second ) of our DNA , albeit already showing contours very close tothe final form .
It is as if humanity had received anenormous librarywith a very precarious catalogue which doesn 't permit us to know how many books exist in all of the stands , nor does it separate out the important works from the mediocre and those of little value .
None of the results indicated by the published studies in the two magazines is definite and unquestionable .
The numbers are provisional and need to be calculated much better , the analyses still need to be refined and there are a series of open questions .
These shortcomings are necessary for a simple reason .
Bluntly speaking , the researchers of the two groups have not reached the final point in the gigantic work into which they have propelled themselves : to establish the correct order of 3.2 billion nitrogenous bases - adenine , cytosine , guanine and thymine , represented respectively by the letters A , C , G and T - dispersed throughout the chromosomes .
In June of last year , the conclusion of more than 80 % of the sequencing of the human genome had been announced , but on that occasion , they didn 't put on paper their findings .
Now they have taken a step forward .
They perfected the initial sketch and wrote pages and pages in the two most influential scientific magazines on the planet about what they had found .
The Public Consortium states that they have broken down around 94 % of the sequences of the nitrogenous bases , a percentage point less than that of Celera .
Or that is to say , there are still considerable holes in our genome - holes which could make the difference , even more so when one knows that only 2 % of the genetic material of man is different from the DNA of the chimpanzee .
Furthermore , a little more than a third of the genes identified have an unknown function .
The end of the beginning - a play on words used by many scientists to say that the sequencing of the human genome is the first stage , not the last , in the search for the deciphering of our DNA - is definitely not completed .
So much so that the Public Consortium admits in the article inNature that only in 2003 might there be a sequencing of the genome with fewer holes .
As a matter of fact , 2003 was the forecast date for the publication of the complete mapping of the genome .
However , as Celera anticipated and decided to publish its work inScience , even though it was not yet complete , the Public Consortium also decided to disclose its material before the programmed time inNature , the main rival of the North American magazine .
" We couldn 't allow a private company to claim the credit for work which could not have been carried out without relying on the information of the public effort " says Dr. Jean Weissenbach , Director of the National Sequencing Center of France , justifying the attitude of the Public Consortium initiative .
The so much commented total of 30,000 human genes is a kind of average of the consensus that seems to have pleased both the scientists of thePublic Consortium and those ofCelera .
Before the publication it was estimated that our species had close to 100,000 genes .
Some estimates went as far as 120,000 , even 140,000 genes .
However , there are those who say that the present forecast of 30,000 genes is as crystalline and indisputable as the result of the last presidential election in the United States .
They are betting that , sooner or later , there will be a recount .
Scientists who have participated in the genomic projects in Brazil believe that there may be more genes as yet undetected by the mathematical computerized models of Celera and the Public Consortium .
The total , they say , could get as high as 50,000 if they were to consider the so-called transcriptor genes which form the molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , the basis for the synthesis of proteins .
Dr. Andrew Simpson , the Coordinator of the Human Cancer Genome ( GHC ) , a project financed by FAPESP and by the Ludwig Institute , is one of those who sustains this projection .
Last year , his team applied on chromosome 22 , one of the smallest and one of the first to be deciphered , the techniques used by the GHC , the ESTs or expressed sequences tags , which indicates only the active parts of the molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .
The result was that the group form São Paulo found 219 new transcriptor regions , which seem to correspond to close to 100 genes which had not at that time been described .
It was so relevant that the discovery found its way into the pages of the issue edition of the 7th of November 2000 of theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States .
Another indicator that the number of human genes could be subject to adjustments comes from another team from São Paulo that worked on the recently concluded genome of sugar cane , which partially mapped the DNA of this plant and tracked close to 80,000 genes ( see Pesquisa Fapesp issue 59 ) .
By crossing the information obtained in the sequencing of sugar cane with that available through the GenBank , a data bank of all of the genomes concluded or in the phase of conclusion , the researchers linked to the FAPESP project found , who would have believed , between 200 and 1,000 genes as yet not identified inArabidopsis thaliana , the first plant entirely sequenced at the end of last year .
Even if figures are not precise , the result of the comparison could increase by as much as 5 % the total of genes ( 25,000 ) forecast forArabidopsis thaliana .
If new genes were found for this plant , why cannot the same thing happen for the human genome ?
The critics of genetic determinism , in general people and scientists in the area of the humanities , but also notable biologists such as Dr. Richard Lewontin , of Harvard University in the United States , gained some ground with the news of the supposed shortage of genes of Homo sapiens .
With so few genes , how can we believe that all we are - physical appearance , tendency to illness and personal preferences - merely depends on DNA and relegate to the underground the role of the environment ?
More incisive critics decree the death of the concept of the gene , as did theFolha de S. Paulo ( Leading Brazilian Newspaper ) in an editorial shortly after the publication of the data of the Public Consortiumand Celera .
In what appears to be a change in attitude , Craig Venter , owner and main scientist of Celera , certainly one of the men who dreamt most of making money by the study of genes , has begun to put out a series of anti-bombastic declarations about the weight of the sequencing of As , Cs , Gs and Ts in our existence , after the publication of the article of his company .
" The assembling of the sequencing of the human genome is only the first and hesitant step of a long and exciting journey in the direction of understanding the role of the genome in human biology . "
Dr. Francis Collins , the main coordinator of the work of the Public Consortium on the human genome , did not follow Dr. Venter on his moderated discourse .
Days after the publication of the article by his team , Dr. Collins participated in the annual meeting of the American Association for the Progress of Science in San Francisco in the United States , and insisted in propagating the cliché idea that DNA is the " book of life , " a metaphor that Venter , also present at this scientific meeting , made a point of rebuffing it .
The two , who have always had so many differences of opinion - regarding patenting and the methods of sequencing of genes - managed to add one more item to their list of differences .
It was already known that the size of the genome - the number of pairs of bases - does not bear a relation to the evolutionary status of the organism .
A protozoon , theAmoeba dubia , has 670 billion pairs of bases in its genome - 220 times greater than that of the human being .
Nor is the only creature which beats the Homo sapiens .
Even the dog , our best friend , leaves man behind : theCanis familiares must have about 100 million pairs more than their owners .
Our quantity of genes , after the new projections were lowered to 30,000 , is also no longer , by itself , a motive of pride for the species .
According to the Public Consortium , the human chromosomes and those of a mouse show a lot of similarities : there are at the minimum 200 segments with at least two common genes and in the same order .
In genomic comparison , the DNA of the human is placed side by side with that of other organisms .
The conclusions can be surprising .
After analyzing 120 repair genes of DNA , the guardians of the genome , who fix the damages that occur in this molecule , he and his team found notable similarities and , at the same time , distinct differences between the genomes of man , animals , yeasts ( fungi ) , bacteria and plants ( sugar cane andArabidopsis ) .
The same gene can be found in diverse species , but the plants , for example , might have genes only found in man or types of bacteria , or not have the genes indispensable to other organisms .
" The worst thing is when we find nothing in these comparisons of the genomes .
At the end of last year , she found for the first time a bacterium repair gene in humans - the some one that afterwards was seen working in chloroplasts , a part of the vegetable cell in which photosynthesis takes place .
" Genomes are mixtures of genomes . "
The two almost complete sequences of the human genome brought with them new evidence that , at least from the genetic point of view , there are no significant differences that justify the notion of race to qualify human beings .
The genome of one person is equal to 99.99 % of its composition when confronted with the DNA of any other individual on the face of the earth - white , black , yellow or of indigenous origin .
Celera estimates that the differences between the genome of two people can be summed up in 1,250 pairs of bases with distinct " letters . "
The article by the company affirms that the genetic differences between people who belong to the same ethnic group could be even larger than between two individuals of distinct races .
This news , obviously , is good and contributes , hopefully one hopes , to diminish racial prejudice .
However , one cannot interpret it in an erroneous form .
Caused by a modification in the hemoglobin , as a resultant alteration in a gene , the falciform anemia has , for example , a greater occurrence in the Black population .
Also , another type of anemia , thalassaemia , also provoked by beta genetic alterations , shows a greater incidence in individuals of Mediterranean origin .
" In some cases , people from different ethnic groups can have distinct responses to the same drug .
Although they are not the final version of the human genome , the two sketches of our DNA contain enough data in quantity and quality to push forward research in the most varied of areas for years and years .
" Groups throughout the world are going to publish work using the information of the sequencing . "
As soon as the articles inScience and Nature came out , the physicist Dr. Murilo da Silva Baptista , of the Physics Institute of USP , called the biologists he knew .
The proof of the existence of a rule which controls the occurrence of codons could help to anticipate when one of them should appear again .
They are systems with their own rules but which , nobody has any idea why , present mathematical characteristics in common with the oscillation of the economic indicators of the stock market and with the behavior of the atomic particles electrically charged , the so called plasma .
As it is known , the genes produce proteins , molecules which form the cells and tissue , whose excess or scarcity can cause disease .
Many known molecules are proteins : hemoglobin , insulin , hormones and neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin - without mentioning the enzymes , indispensable for chemical reactions .
The proteins account for close to 90 % of the dry weight of blood , 80 % of muscle and 70 % of skin .
In man , the study of the interaction of proteins promises to be a task which will be even more complicated than that of deciphering the genome .
One of the reasons is that nobody has a very clear idea of the size of our proteome .
In contrast with DNA , identical in whatever part of the body , the proteins produced in one type of cell are not the same as those found in others .
Since man has close to 100 trillion cells , this time it will be difficult to quickly arrive at a consensus of opinion .
From now onwards , the estimates vary between 100,000 and 1 million proteins .
Both the public consortium and Celera have begun research into this field .
In Brazil , there are few groups specialized in this area .
Outside of São Paulo , one of the few is the Brazilian Center of Services and Research into Proteins at the University of Brasilia ( UnB ) .
For some scientists , the race towards proteome is inevitable , but it is occurring in a hasty way .
Before tackling the proteins , they say , it would be suitable to understand the transcriptome , the group of genes that as they are expressed , generate molecules of RNA necessary for the synthesis of proteins .
When they manage to demonstrate that a region of DNA is a transcript , the researchers establish that there is one or more genes .
The Initiative for the Validation of Human Transcriptome , a recently initiated project between FAPESP and the Ludwig Institute , intends to find 4,000 transcript genes over the next two years .
Thirty one laboratories are participating in the project , budgeted at US $ 1 million .
" We 've still got a lot of genes to find and validate . "

Equal forces ( Interview )
The environment could be as determining as the genes themselves
In 1992 , disillusioned with the bureaucracy of the NIH ( National Institute of Health ) of the United States , he decided to start a genomic research institute .
Created in Rockville , in the State of Maryland , a half-hour drive from the capital , Washington DC , the TIGR ( The Institute for Genomic Research ) has become a productive center of studies and sequencing .
In 1998 , Dr. Venter began to definitely write his name into the history of genomics .
In that year he started up the company Celera , also in Rockville , with a clear purpose : to establish the correct order of the 3 billion pairs of bases which make up the human genome within a maximum time scale of three years , a lot less time than that originally proposed by the international Public Consortium which had planned to hit the same goal only in 2005 .
The promised year of the complete sequencing was advanced from 2005 to 2003 .
With the arrival of 2001 , one can say that Celera kept its promise , though not quite fully .
The company published a version of the human genome which still contains gaps and is not definite , the same thing that happened to the work of the Public Consortium .
The revelation that the human genome has less genes than that was expected , is a good thing or a bad thing ?
It is a good base for the researchers to follow up .
Does it mean that it will be easier or more difficult to understand the genome ?
Ironically , the low number of genes shows that biology is more complicated than lots of people would like it to be .
Many people thought on the basis of " one gene , one protein , one biological function , one illness . "
However , thing don 't work like that .
I believe that the sequencing of the genome has helped to demonstrate something that many of us already knew , but weren 't fully aware of the extent of the complications .
Less genes in the human being means less genes to be patented .
How does Celera see this question ?
This is irrelevant .
To patent genes is not a key factor in what Celera is doing .
It has never been .
Our goal is to help the rest of the scientific community , pharmacology and pharmaceutics to understand how to use the human genome tin order o develop better diagnostics and therapies .
This is our only goal , to develop new treatments for diseases .
Can the genome still be considered the " book of life " ?
Do you agree with the researchers who say that the information on the genome is a bad blow to the determinism genetics ?
I 'm one of those people whom you are referring to .
I hope I agree with this ( laughing ) .
There are many different terms used to describe the genome : book of life , photograph of humanity .
The genetic code is not a portrait of a human being , nor the dictionary of life .
It holds important parts to our history , important instructions for our cells , about how to modify them .
The information is on the following levels , in the interplay between the proteins and between the structures of the cells .
All of this is not directly codified in our DNA .
From here onwards , will the influence of the environment be re-evaluated regarding the appearance of illnesses ?
Our studies show that , in a general form , genes and the environment have probably the same importance .
In each illness , in each human condition there is an different mix of the influence of these two factors .
The biological molecule proves that the environment is really an essential part of life , of biology .
They are not separated .
Do you believe that this idea is acceptable among the majority of researchers ?
This is something that I cannot assure you .
I 've had the opportunity to think about this much more than most people .
What comes after the genome ?
All the rest of biology .
There is not a one , single step which will solve everything .
We have to integrate all of the information in order to understand biology .
Many people have been talking about proteome as the next step of the genomics .
We have a lot of research being developed about the separation and sequencing of proteins .
How do you make a comparison of the data of Celera with that of the Public Consortium ?
We believe that the Consortium has done a great job .
However , the data bank of Celera is substantially more accurate .
Our sequencing is in a more correct order , something that the Public Consortium will take another two or three years to complete .
One thing is to have the parts of the sequencing , another is to put them in the correct order and to obtain the correct sequencing of the genes .
That is the reason that the data bank of Celera is so popular with the scientists .
They know we have the better data by far .
How many clients does the Celera data bank have ?
Up until yesterday ( the 1st of March ) , we had 37 clients , including schools of medicine and academic institutions such as the Rockefeller Institute .
Scientists throughout the world , such as the Karolinska Institute of Sweden , and the Max Planck Institute , trust our information .
Is this number of clients sufficiently large for you ?
Celera has been around for only two and a half years .
During this time we sequenced theDrosophila melanogaster ( fruit fly ) , the human genome and now the mouse .
All of this in two and a half years .
We are waiting for Brazil to sign on to our service .
Brazilian researchers , the majority being financed by FAPESP , have produced a large quantity of data on the human genome , a million ESTs of the codifying regions of the genes .
How do you yourself evaluate the quality of this information ?
I don 't have specific knowledge about the human ESTs produced in Brazil .
However , I know that other sequences of ESTs , the first that were obtained in your country and that were produced in collaboration with my institute ( TIGR , The Institute for Genomic Research ) , were of high quality .
The Brazilian scientists carried out an excellent piece of research in the sequencing of the first plant pathogen ( theXylella fastidiosa ) .
In Brazil , the researchers have been talking more about the study of transcriptome rather than the proteome for the next few years , different from what is going on abroad .
Why do you think this is happening and what is the importance of transcriptome ?
It is a term that nobody recognizes , as far as I know , as a valid term from the scientific point of view .
For this reason you don 't often hear it mentioned .
I believe that I have never used this word in this context .
People are studying RNA all the time .
It is an intermediary which could help with some indications on the variations in the proteins , but it cannot say with any great precision what happens to the proteins .
Then do you consider the study of proteome to be much more important that that of transcriptome ?
My position is to adopt a holistic view of biology .
I try not to make judgments ...
You would not have a single protein in the body without RNA and no RNA without the genome .
Everything is important and needs to be studied and understood .
The greater part of biology occurs at the proteins level .
People measure RNA to generally attempt to guess how much protein exists .
Both techniques are very important .
Do you believe that the software used for the sequencing of the human genome can also be used in the study of proteins ?
We are developing new software to handle the proteins but the understanding of it is totally based on an understanding of the genome .
When one deals with an integrated system , all the components are necessary .
However , we will definitely need new and better software and computers .
Did all that was published in Nature and Science about the human genome make you change some of your more intimate convictions , such as in God , in destiny or in human evolution ?
No .
Not one of my convictions changed .

Between cities and deserts
Not everyone took up graphs , tables and long scientific dissertations in order to understand the human genome .
Dr. Bob Waterson , Director of the Genome Center of the University of Washington in St .
Louis , United States , didn 't hesitate in putting forward metaphors with the proposition of clarifying the irregularity with which the genes distribute themselves along the human chromosomes .
" In some regions the genes are pretty piled up , like the buildings in a city . "
he said " But there are as well large deserts where the junk DNA can be found , and each region contains unique information about the history of our species . "
This scenario strongly contrasts with the genome of other species such as theArabidopsis , the C. elegans or the Drosophila - much more uniform , sprawling out into suburbs , with a relatively regular distribution of genes on the chromosomes .
The urban centers , dense in genes , are constituted primarily by blocks of two nitrogenous bases , guanine and cytosine , G and C. However , the deserts or junk DNA areas are rich in adenines and thymines , A and T .
On each chromosome there are long stretches of GC , one with a density of 60 % and the other with only 30 % for example .
This never happens in a pattern and constitutes what Dr. Waterson calls neighborhoods , with distinct accents .
Close to the cities there are stretches in which only the bases G and C repeat themselves , 30,000 times or more .
It is a consequence of the so called alternative splicing in which the parts of a protein can be rearranged in a different manner - ABC , CBA or BAC in the hypothetical case of only three elements - , like pieces of a toy to be put together .
This process is possible because the genes are spread out along the DNA and the regions which codify the proteins are not necessarily continuous .
The human species has expanded the families of proteins .
It is calculated that close to 60 % of the families of human proteins contain more elements than in any other species .
And the majority of the groups of proteins are associated with physiological functions more developed in the vertebrates .
The Science article lists 247 genes which are development regulators or are associated with the nervous system , the interaction of proteins , to signal molecules or to the reply of the immunology system , in man , in theDrosophila , in C. elegans , in yeast and inArabidopsis - and we beat them superbly .
The refinement is evident : only the human organisms , among those that have been studied , produce genes of interleukin , a type of antibody .
We also have close to three times more a group of proteins which regulate the response to infections , called immunoglobins than the fruit flies and worms do , and they are absent in fungi and plants .
An analysis of the genome detected the presence of remnants of a migration which occurred in our first vertebrate ancestors .
As they had little defense against parasitic invaders , the bacteria were able to become resistant in the interior of the organisms .
The result of this coexistence is that the human genome houses close to 200 genes which appear to come from bacteria or from intermediary genomes of viruses , though the hypothesis that that the bacteria might have also stolen genes from ancestral vertebrates cannot be entirely discarded .
According to the article inNature , close to half of the genome is derived from the so called jumping genes or transposons - genes which leap from one point to another of the chromosome or even from one chromosome to another and regulate the function of other genes .
Another interesting point is that which the scientists are calling " the mania of collecting things , " in contrast to other species .
The quantity of junk in our genome exceeds that of much older species , with the exception of the ameba .
It has been calculated that the drosophila cleaned its house close to 12 million years ago , while the mammals about 800 million years ago .

A bench marker detects cancer
A protein can identify bladder cancer in a urine test with precision
With the goal of finding out at the very moment of diagnosis what the evolution of the illness in each patient will be - which would simplify the choice of treatment - the urologist Dr. Marco Aurélio Silva Lipay , of the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) , studied the glycoprotein CD44 as a marker molecule for cancer of the bladder .
A substance which participates in the structuring of the tissues and one f the membranes of the cells , like cement in a wall , it is already used in the diagnosis of cancer of the kidney and of the breast .
According to Dr. Lipay , whose study was financed by FAPESP , bladder cancer is the fourth most common in the United States ; where close to 50,000 new cases are diagnosed a year .
As cancer is an illness of disordered multiplication of cells , it is presumed that the lack of an integrating element such as CD44 , points to a bad prognosis , as the degree of aggressiveness of the cancer is directly related to the production of metastasis cells that break away from the original tumor .
Still in an experimental phase , the CD44 method depends on a biopsy - a removal of a sample of the infected region for analysis .
Dr. Lipay intends to increase the sensitivity of the test and turn it non-invasive , detecting the presence or absence of CD44 in the urine .
After the collection of the urine , centrifuging takes place to obtain the cells that have come off the internal mucus of the bladder .
The RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) of these cells is extracted and enlarged for reaction in a polymer chain .
If the CD44 is present , the RNA that promotes its production will also be enlarged for reaction .
The ideal would be for us to have a single marker . "
The cancer of the bladder generally begins in the mucus and , at the moment of diagnosis , it is impossible to know if the patient will be cured or not .
" Cancer is a genetic illness at the somatic level : or that is , before the illness shows itself , the cells pass through various steps of molecular alterations . "
The geneticist Dr. Monica Vanucci Nunes Lipay , who guided the project together with the urologist Dr. Flavio Hering , both from Unifesp , adds : " Genetic factors , such as tobacco use , could interfere in the process , making the alterations easier .
Cancer is an illness of multiple steps .
If an individual has a genetic alteration that indicates a tendency to develop the illness but was not exposed to the aggressive agents , it may well bethat the person will never develop the cancer . "
Dr. Lipay will continue on his line of research towards the creation of a pool of markers for tumors that represent the real situation of the patient .

The largest water reservoir of South America might have excess radioactivity
The immense fountain of underground waters called the Guarani Aquifer , a resource little publicized by the countries of the Mercosul , has been the object of studies which should help its preservation and safe use by the populations of the vast area which it covers .
The quality of the water is considered good in many areas , but the physicist Dr. Daniel Marcos Bonotto , Professor of Geochemistry at the Institute of Geosciences and Exact Sciences of the São Paulo State University ( Unesp - the Portuguese acronym ) in Rio Claro , points out some problems .
In various wells , he has found excessive levels of the radioactive elements radon and radium , associated with lung and stomach cancer .
Another conclusion is that in the less deep zones the underground reservoir is being contaminated by the leftovers from the pork industry , from coal mining and toxic products of industrial and agricultural origin .
" We found even an increase in the level of nitrates in the water of a well in Ribeirão Preto , and the source is untreated sewage . "
The area is equivalent to the total territory of Peru , Spain , France and Great Britain .
The reservoir is estimated to contain 50,000 km3 of fresh water , enough for the whole world for ten years .
Its use for human consumption must be based on studies that attest to its potability or point to the necessity of a pre-treatment .
In Brazil , the researches carried out on the reservoir were developed above all from the 70s onwards by the Department of Water and Electrical Energy ( DAEE the Portuguese acronym ) of the State of São Paulo .
However , there is still a lack of more precise hydrogeological data about these reserves .
For this reason , Brazil and the other countries of the Mercosul began in 2001 a project to produce an in-depth study and to create a model for the administration of the use of the waters of the aquifer and for its environmental protection .
The project has the support of the World Fund for the Environment ( Global Environment Facility-GEF ) and will be able to count on investments of US $ 25 million from the countries involved until 2005 .
The researcher collected and chemically analyzed , three times each , 80 samples of subterranean water of tubular artesian wells in almost 70 cities and towns in the States of São Paulo , Mato Grosso do Sul , Paraná , Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul .
The selection of the wells was made in collaboration with DAEE ( The Department of Water and Electrical Energy ) in São Paulo and Araraquara and with the Research Company of Mineral Resources ( CPRM ) in São Paulo and Porto Alegre .
The researcher also took into account information generated from similar studies carried out at the Institute of Geosciences of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) under the coordination of Professor Aldo da Cunha Rebouças , considered to be one of the best authorities on the question .
For Dr. Rebouças , the data might not be representative , given the possibility of contamination within the laboratory .
He thinks it would be advisable to collect a new series of samples from each well to prove the analysis .
Dr. Bonotto does not believe in the possibility of contamination within the laboratory and evaluates that , in the case of the radioactivity , the values found could even be an underestimation , due to the losses that occurred in the process .
Anyhow , as the partial results show that the reference value of the radioactivity is high in many municipalities and this could mean that the use of the waters of the aquifer for human consumption in some localities is endangered .
More or less 200municipalities in the São Paulo State get their water totally or partially from the reservoir , which is also used in irrigation , and in the food , drinks and textile industries .

The measurements and the necessary cautions
In the case of uranium , Dr. Daniel Bonotto confirmed that the average radioactivity of the 80 samples of water analyzed is well below the maximum level recommended , which proves the potability of the water in relation to the isotopes of uranium U238 and U234 .
In that well , the level of cadmium exceeded by 20 times the maximum limit established by the Special Technical Law ( NTA-60 ) about water for general consumption in the State of São Paulo , approved by the State Decree No 12,486 .
Concerning radon , the researcher found elevated levels in the waters of the majority of the wells analyzed .
As there is not any Brazilian legislation about the intake of radon , Dr. Bonotto compared the results with the limits of 300 pCi / l ( picoCuries per liter ) proposed in 1991 by the Agency for the Environment Protection of the United States ( Usepa ) .
More than half of the wells analyzed , including some used for human consumption , overstepped this limit .
There were high levels of radon in the waters of the wells of Maringá ( 3,303 pCi / l ) , Londrina ( 2,453 pCi / l ) and Cornélio Procópio ( 2,408 pCi / l ) in Paraná , but none of them was used for human consumption .
In São Paulo , however , water from the wells used for human consumption revealed the levels of radon to be superior to the limits established by international legislation in Fernandópolis ( 2,902 pCi / l ) , São José do Rio Preto ( 1,272 pCi / l ) , Catanduva ( 1,272 pCi / l ) , Lins ( 1,516 pCi / l ) and Ribeirão Preto ( 718 pCi / l ) .
Dr. Aldo Rebouças added that as the half-life of radon is very short , by the time that the water is consumed by people the radon gas has already disappeared .
Nevertheless he agrees that it is necessary to carry out treatment in the case of the water which is taken from an artesian well and channeled immediately into the network for distribution .
Even then , according to the researcher at Unesp , even when the radon disappears from the waters stored in reservoirs or tanks , radioactive lead could remain , which is one of radon 's offspring .
As the level of radon is high , Dr. Bonotto suspects that the element from which it originates , radium , could also be high and he took another sample collection from the 80 wells .
The analyses confirmed his suspicions in some wells , with levels of radium up to four times higher than the maximum limit established by Brazilian legislation for the total emission of alpha radioactivity by radioactive elements , among them radium226 .
Dr. Bonotto explains that radium has a high degree of radioactive toxicity , a large tendency to fix itself into our bones , a long half-life of 1,622 years and a high potential to produce biological damage as it is gives off alpha radioactivity .
According to him , the maximum concentration of radium226 in the waters suggested by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , is of 1 Bequerel per liter ( Bq / l ) .
The criteria put into place in Brazil is based on the Judicial Directive N ° 36 of the 19th of January 1990 from the Ministry of Health , which established the reference value of 0.1 Bq / l ( close to 2.7 pCi / l ) for the total alpha radioactivity and of 1 Bq / l for the total beta activity .
The levels found in the samples of some wells are above the limits suggested by the WHO and well in advance of the maximum value of 0.1 Bq / l for the total alpha radioactivity in water , which includes radium , established by Brazilian legislation .
In São Paulo , the researcher verified , for example , that the level of radium in a well in Catanduva is of 1.8 Bq / l , almost twenty times above the level permitted by Brazilian law .
In a well in Monte Alto the level of radium was of 0.7 Bq / l , in Ribeirão Preto of 0.5 Bq / l and in São Simão of 0.5 Bq / l .

In the Amazon , the Brazil Nut trees get older with a reduced chance of renewing themselves because of the intense exploitation of the Brazil Nut tree ( Bertholletia excelsa ) threatens the survival of the agouti ( Dasyprocta spp ) , the main disperser of the nuts .
Already in the remnants of the Mata Atlântica ( Atlantic Rain Forest ) in the interior of the State of São Paulo , the threat looms on dozens of species of trees which depend on the agouti for dispersing their seeds and promoting the regeneration of stretches of forest .
To evaluate the extension of the danger in these stretches , the biologist Dr. Mauro Galetti , of the Institute of Biosciences of the São Paulo University ( Unesp ) , in Rio Claro , studied the interference of the fragmentation of the forest in the dispersion of seeds and is setting up a data bank about the interactions of fruit-eating animals with the species of vegetation.Dr .
They are considered to be the largest sources of natural products and are also responsible for the maintenance of essential resources to man , such as water , and for keeping global temperature .
Nevertheless , the high levels of de-forestation and the conversion of primitive habitats by man , has caused the accentuated decline of both animal and vegetation species .
The worst aspect of the extinction few people notice - the loss of the interactions between the animals and the plants , which are responsible for the maintenance of the forests . "
The scattered fragments in the interior of the country are composed of a semi deciduous forest , where many species lose their leaves during the dry season , called the Mata Atlântica ( Atlantic Rain Forest ) .
" It is the most threatened Brazilian forest which may totally disappear and it will be necessary to have planned management in all of the fragments that remain .
The SOS Mata Atlântica ( Atlantic Rain Forest ) Foundation confirmed that of the 8.9 million hectares of the original area of the semi deciduous forest of the State , there remains only 189,000 hectares or 2.06 % .
Among the studies of the project , Dr. Galetti singled out the dispersion of the seeds of the jatobá tree ( Hymenaea courbaril ) by the agouti .
In the same way as other species of the leguminous family and some palm trees , the jatobá tree has very large seeds , more than 2.5 centimeters in diameter .
Plants with large seeds , which no bird can swallow are the most threatened in the patches of forest .
They are dispersed exclusively by tapirs ( Tapirus terrestris ) and agouti .
Since the tapirs are widely hunted to the point of local extinction , the agouti inherits the title of the only dispersers of these large seeds in the patches of forest .
Just like the squirrel , the tapir eats some of the seeds and buries the rest so as to have food for another season .
When it changes territory , forgets some seeds or is killed by felines , the abandoned seed germinates and gives origin to a new plant .
Dr. Galetti reveals that the agouti is also the target of hunters in parts of the forest in the country of São Paulo State , which threatens the survival of the jatobá and of other 50 species of trees with large fruit , which have in the animal their only disperser , among them are various species of palm trees such as theSyagrus oleracea ) andAstrocaryum aculeatissimum .
The researcher said that the black-capped capuchin monkey ( Cebus apella ) and the Muriqui monkey ( Brachyteles arachnoides ) eat the pulp of the fruit of the jatobá tree and throw away the large and hard seeds , that afterwards are eaten or buried far away by the agouti .
Even if a seed germinates at the foot of the jatobá , the young plant would not be able to compete with the adult for light and nutrients .
As matter of fact , the closer they are to the mother plant , the greater is the possibility the seed being eaten by other rodents and wild boar , attracted by the quantity of fruit under the tree .
This could modify greatly the dynamics of the forest with a domino effect , bringing about unbalances in all of the food chain . "
Covered with birdlime , the seeds stick to the trunk , where they germinate rapidly .
" It is a very delicate relationship of interdependence and we are studying how it can be broken with the environmental disturbances . "
The red and black seed of this species , used in necklaces and bracelets , looks like a succulent fruit that consequently attracts the birds .
It is a parasite system because the plant does not offer anything to the bird , however despite the low level of dispersion , the trick works , when the bird realizes the mistake it has already been swallowed or spit out , then the seed on the ground can germinate .
Imitating this strategy , Dr. Galetti and the students Eliana Cazeta and Cecília Costa made artificial fruit with modeling clay in order to verify alterations in the behavior of birds that eat the fruit of shrubs .
They distributed white red and black artificial fruit , the colors of the fruit that the birds eat , on the edges and deep in the stretches of forest .
They chose the band of the semi-thicket because in it , with less tall trees , close to 85 % of the plants are dispersed by birds or bats and only 15 % by a mechanism of the plant itself , such as explosion , which throws the seeds far away .
In the band of high trees such as the jequitibá ( Cariniana legalis ) , with 30 to 40 meters in height , the animals only disperse the seeds of half of the species , the other half is dispersed by the effect of the wind or by the plant itself .
" The results , " related Dr. Galetti " showed that the taller forests had more fruit pecked and removed than the shorter ones , indicating a probable diminution of dispersion of seeds by birds in the small patches .
Moreover , black fruit are less pecked by the birds in the deep of the forest than at the edge , while for the red fruit there was no difference between the edge and the middle .
This experiment showed , for the first time , that the fragmentation of a forest affects the possibility of a fruit being dispersed by a bird , depending on the color of the fruit and where the plant is located in the environment .
For this reason , it is expected that smaller patches of forest possess more shrubs with black fruit on the edge than forests that haven 't greatly altered .
Nobody imagined that the forest fragmentation could affect differently the species of the semi-thicket depending on the color of the fruit . "
This simple experiment pointed to an important risk factor for the regeneration of fragmented forests , the fringe effect .
Dr. Galetti explained that when the forest is fragmented , its fringes receive much more wind and sunshine than the core , which diminishes considerably humidity among other impacts .
This facilitates the invasion of exotic species not native to the forest .
For example , grass does not occur inside a preserved forest , where it does not have any means way to compete for the light .
The grass which invades the fringe , however , stalls the regeneration of forest in that location .
The cycle goes on , the more light on the fringe , less humidity , greater invasion of grass or of other exotic species .
This process of strangulation of the original forest could lead to many fragmented pieces of forest and its disappearance in less than 100 years .
The more or less aggressive attack of the fringe affect on a piece of forest depends on many variables , which require a study in the specific management of each area .
" In forest fragments that have plantations of eucalyptus skirting them , there is less fringe effect than in those surrounded by sugar cane or pasture .
This is because the eucalyptuses break the action of the wind , which could knock down lots of trees on the fringe .
As there is no regeneration on the edge due to the grass , the forest goes on diminishing more and more . " The
Although there are some clear patterns as in the case of the jatobá , the variables of each fragment f forest are so many , that each area responded in its own manner .
Each patch of forest has its unique history of disturbance , type of surrounding such as coffee , sugar cane or eucalyptus , pressure of hunting and other difficulties . "
Summing up , if there are no animals to carry out for free the dispersion of seeds in order to recompose the forest and maintain it self-sufficient , it will be necessary to replant species and also to reintroduce the animals .
Dr. Galetti adds that the fragments of forest need to be managed continually : introducing into the environment disperser animals such as the agouti and to control hunting , for example , could make the animal population increase more than need be and cause another impact in the food chain .
" Once a disturbance has taken place in the forest , it is difficult to remake mother nature . "
Who ends up doing the managing is a biologist or the forest engineer .
All the units of conservation should have a group of researchers dedicated to the local managing .
Without adequate management , we will be losing our biodiversity more and more .
This shows a huge field of work for biologists in this area , much more than in biotechnology . "
" Firstly , the coffee wave knocked down almost all of the forest , mainly because access was very easy in a flat region .
An then the cycles of sugar cane and eucalyptus came .
An isolated fragment of forest in a sea of sugar cane has no chance to receive seeds and loses its diversity over the time . "
The project looked at patches stands of forest , four with close to 300 hectares and four above 1,000 hectares ( see insert ) .
In the Cerrados - a typeof a wooded Savannah , another ecosystem that , like the Mata Atlântica , is recorded on the list of the 25 areas of richest and most threatened biodiversity on the planet according to the preservationist organization Conservation International , the biologist considers the situation less serious as to the reproduction of species than in the semi deciduous forest .
" Many plants of the Cerrados have vegetative reproduction and do not depend only on fruit .
If they are cut down , theyre-sprout or throw out a long root and generate another individual further on , while in the forest the majority of the trees that are cut don 't re-sprout . "
Dr. Galetti comments that the dispersion of seeds is a very new line of research in the country .
He , who took his doctorate at the University of Cambridge in England , on a study of the dispersion of the seeds of the palm tree ( Euterpe edulis ) in the Mata Atlântica , also studied in Indonesia the dispersion done by bears and hornbills ( birds of various species and genres similar to toucans ) .
On his return , he obtained from FAPESP the incentive to begin in 1997 this present project , which should be concluded in July .
In 1998 he began teaching in the Department of Ecology of the São Paulo State in Rio Claro ( Unesp ) , and set up the Phenology Group and Seed Dispersion Group along with professor Patricia Morellato of the Botany Department .
Apart from Dr. Galetti 's group , few within the State of São Paulo dedicate themselves to this area .
Dr. Wesley Rodrigues Silva , of the Institute of Biology of the University of Campinas , and Dr. Jean Paul Metzger , of the Institute of Biosciences of the University of São Paulo ( IB-USP ) , are coordinating projects in the Biota-FAPESP Program .
Also in IB-USP , Dr. José Carlos Motta Jr. has meetings with researchers dedicated to the question .
To attract more interest in the area , Dr. Galetti and Dr. Wesley Silva organized the Third International Symposium of Fruit and Seed Dispersion between the 6th and the 11th of August past in São Pedro ( a tourist center in the State of São Paulo ) and which had more than 300 participants from 30 countries .
There , Dr. Galetti 's group presented 15 studies and the award for the best poster was given for the work of two researchers from IB -USP on the dispersion of the Brazil Nut of Para by the agouti .
The work was carried out on the indigenous lands of the Caiapó Indians in the south west of the State of Pará , as part of the Pinkaiti Project .
Dr. Claúdia Baider worked on the demography and dispersion of the seeds as her doctorate thesis , while Maria Luisa da Silva Pinto Jorge took her master degree studying the life , daily activity and population density of the agouti .
Orientated by Dr. Carlos Augusto da Silva Peres of IB-USP , they carried out their research in one of the few remaining Brazil Nut tree locations still unexplored in the Amazon , about two hours by boat from the village of A 'Ukre , close to the town of Redenção .
The forest of the Brazil Nut tree which was studied is open , with boscages of palms , bamboos and lianas .
There is a dry season of five months and for half of it not a drop of water falls .
Cláudia states that the major part of the Brazil Nut trees are in conglomerates , which could have resulted from the pattern of dispersion of the agouti .
The agouti eats the nuts but buries some seeds which end up germinating .
It takes away the fruit in all directions and can cover large distances , but distributes the majority of the seeds relatively close to the trees .
The fruit , which weighs between 800 grams and 1.5 kilograms , is made of wooden shell covered by another shell of bark .
It is extremely hard and the agouti takes between 40 and 50 minutes to gnaw a hole in it until it reaches the nuts .
The Brazil Nut tree is important for the extraction economy of the Amazon , but its uncontrolled extraction is threatening the survival of the agouti and of the Brazil Nut tree itself .

The fruit and their seed spreaders
Color , size and other characteristics of fruit are important on order to be identified by the dispersers of seeds .
Dr. Galetti revealed that fruit dispersed by birds are generally red or black and sweet tasting such as the pau de viola tree ( Citharexyllum mirianthum ) and the Brazil cherry ( Eugenia spp . ) , or fatty such as the nutmegs ( Virola spp . ) .
Those dispersed by mammals are almost always sweet , yellow , pungent and pithy , such as the guava ( Campomanesia spp . ) and the bakupari ( Rheedia gardneriana ) .
There are even those adapted to dispersion by ants , such as the castor bean ( Riccinus communis ) and the capixingui ( Croton floribundus ) , which have a small oily reward for the insects .

What can one learn from animals as distinct as a salamander , a cat or a spider ?
Scientists from the University of São Paulo in São Carlos are learning to see .
The study of the biological model has been indispensable for uncovering the secrets of one of the most complex attributions of the brain , namely vision , which afterwards they intend to teach to a computer .
There are advances both in the theoretical and in the practical .
We could still be a far distance from Hal , the witty computer ofClark 's Space Odyssey 2001 , or even the almost human androids ofBlade Runner , but the research group into Cybernetic Vision have already exhibited virtual neurons that create their own life within the virtual environment and that can be controlled in accordance with the rules inferred from research with real cells .
Now , this is the way to carry out the reverse : to understand , from a mathematical model , how the natural neurons integrate among themselves , a task almost impossible by ordinary means , as the neurons in the laboratory can only be studied in isolation .
The accumulated knowledge of the team has served for the development of applied projects .
It has already permitted the construction of a mechanical eye , finished up last year , based on the visual system of a spider .
Two examples : to Hewlett Packard of Brazil , he created a quality control system for video monitors , and with Intelligent Network , from the United States , a program for recognition of patterns and artificial intelligence in computer networks and on the Internet .
The practical applications of computational vision , in the most diverse sectors , are immense and attract the interest of companies and universities throughout the world .
Abroad , it is estimated that this area has a turnover of close to US $ 5 billion , even when the mechanisms of the computerized vision still suffer from limitations .
For example , machines for visual inspection can already tell broken biscuits from whole biscuits , but still have difficulty in distinguishing objects of similar shapes such as oranges from apples or male from female faces .
Conscious of the strategic importance of this area of research , the group based in São Carlos has consolidated itself as one of the most useful in this area in Brazil , as it is multidisciplinary .
The team includes specialists in computing , mathematics , physics , and electrical and mechanical engineering .
There are also neuroscientists , medical doctors , psychologists and even philosophers .
The majority of them have already completed their doctorate , so it might seem weird that a spider or a salamander could teach a group of qualified Homo sapiens something about an inborn and apparently so simple skill such as vision .
After all , it seems that it takes less effort to see than doing calculations or making decisions , for example .
Not quite .
" There is a tendency to consider vision as a simple process and the image that we see as an direct impression from the world around us . " says Dr. Costa , who coordinated the recently completed projectResearch into Cybernetic Vision financed by FAPESP .
" Actually , vision is a refined process , which requires almost half of the capacity of the cerebral cortex of a primate and it consists in the passage of a physical image for interpretation . "
We are speaking of a collection of processes capable of identifying and locating the existing objects in the world from visual information captured by sensors , an ability that not even the most sophisticated machines have managed to master up to now .
" If we compared the nervous system to a machine , " he said " the vision program would be totally codified in the neurons . "
So , the first step of the research consists in the understanding and in the classification of the nerve cells .
The human brain has hundreds of types of neurons and everything indicates that these differences are be determined by internal interactions and external interactions to the individual , since our genetic material is not sufficient to justify so vast a number of forms .
The theory is not original .
At the end of the 19th century , the Spanish doctor Santiago Ramón y Cajal ( 1852-1934 ) , a pioneer in the study of neural tissue , attributed the form of the neurons to human intelligence itself .
Dr. Cajal got , along with the Italian Camillo Golgi ( 1843-1926 ) , the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1906 and passed into history as the creator of modern neuroscience , but his interest for the neuronal form did not receive greater attention throughout the 20th century .
In Brazil , the so called neuromorphometry would continue as a field of research practically unheard of until the Cybernetic Vision Group began their studies as to how form could influence the behavior of the neurons .
" The definition of the form of a neuron may be directly linked to the establishment of synaptic connections .
More complex cells , with greater in-depth roots , connect themselves to a greater number of cells .
The study concentrated itself on two types of neurons , the ganglionic cells and the pyramidal cells , the former of the retina of the cat and the salamander and the latter of the rat .
Since the laboratory of the group at the Institute of Physics of São Carlos does not work with animals , the images of the real neurons were sent by research partners , such as the Department of Physiology of the University of Minnesota in the United States , and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) .
The researchers built the virtual neuron systems from the real images , analyzed by statistical methods and by graphics computer .
With the images , they can better understand the function of the neurons , fundamental to vision , and to simulate real situations .
This is the so called cybernetic vision , the expression that the researchers adopted for this area to represent the interface between biological vision and computerized vision .
However , what they really want is to generate realistic neurons , statistically similar to the natural ones .
To get there , the first , and possibly most difficult challenge is to establish patterns of classification .
What does a neuron of a ganglionic cell of the retina of a cat do to distinguish it from any other ?
It was necessary to choose a set of measurements that would represent each group of neurons , such as size , width , orientation and angles of the segments of the dentrites , the ramifications for this type of cell .
According to Dr. Costa , the choice of these parameters is still an open question , which should take into account what you want to look into .
The question of the extraction of the measurements , the key point in the creation of the virtual nervous system , is also fundamental for the development of a visual cybernetic mechanism .
From any scene , the computer will have to capture the image that interests it , as does the biological eye , and from it extract the attributes ( or measurements ) necessary for its recognition .
The secret is to know what measurements are capable of transforming the image into efficient algorithms ( mathematical models or expressions ) of identification .
For example , in the middle of a group of people what makes men and women statistically different form one another ?
Height , hair length , facial angles ?
What to the animal seems to be instinctive , the computer will have to learn step by step .
Developing a more efficient system of recognition was the objective of one of the first practical pieces of work carried out by the Cybernetic Vision Research Group , through the construction of a mechanical eye .
The work began in 1993 when Dr. Costa came back from his doctorate at King 's College in London , and was finished up last year .
The model used was the visual system of various species of jumping spiders of the family Salticidae , chosen for having a well evolved system of vision .
According to Dr. Costa , this species possesses the most developed visual system amongst the terrestrial vertebrates and , if you include aquatic creatures , only loses to the octopus .
Besides this , it manages to detect segments of a straight line , an ideal ability for the development of a mechanical eye , as it can the storage of information easier .
Imprisoned in front of a computer screen , It watched the image of hypothetical prey and predator and the researchers observed its reactions .
Dr. Costa now recognizes that this type of approach was flawed as the human observation is subjective , or that is to say , different observers could arrive at different conclusions .
That is why , shortly afterwards the work became more sophisticated with the inclusion of an electronic stethoscope .
Placed on the stomach of the spider , the device measured the abdominal micro movements , where the heart of the animal is located , and obtained a more objective measurement of response to stimuli .
The researchers observed that the jumping spider was able to quickly recognize whether the image projected on the screen was of another spider or not .
The retina of the jumping spider , with an elongated shape like that of a boomerang and able to move , while the cornea remains fixed ( just the contrary of the human eye ) , served as a model for the creation of a prototype of a mechanical eye that would detect straight lines efficiently in order to recognize objects right away .
This was a system of the estimation of the population density , in order to monitor areas where crowds are gathered .
Since in a crowd only parts of the bodies appear , the computer does get to recognize individual human beings .
The technique is based on differences of patterns of texture .
Images of low density of people tend to present a thick texture , while denser images present finer textures .
So , the images are classified into different categories of texture .
Afterwards , statistics of these classes are used to estimate the number of people .
Even more surprising is the program that evaluates visual perception , an attribute still little known by scientists and very much influenced by the environment , social-cultural context and emotions .
" If our perception were linear , it would be enough to measure the original image , take the difference and establish standards of quality . "
However , the image can have distortions and yet be agreeable .
An adequate model to evaluate the quality of the images would have to be capable of considering the subtleties of the human visual system .
It was exactly this that the computer did .
Last year the researchers invited a group of 20 people of different social segments to attribute grade to about 50 images .
Beginning with the grades , associated to measurements such as dimensions , contrast and color , the specialists designed an algorithm that permitted the computer to evaluate other images .
Following this , they compared the two judgments .
Humans and machine valued points such as artistic quality and originality , attributes directly related to the cultural context .
The major surprise was that the grades given by the humans and afterwards by the computerized model were very similar .
As the images remained on the screen for only a few seconds , a possible justification for the incredible agreement is that they had been evaluating more primitive measurements .
In the human being , the visual information goes first through the base of the occipital lobe , a region of the cerebral cortex located near the nape of the neck and responsible for the recognition of segments of straight lines that make up the primary processing of the visual information .
If the image were to stay on the screen for more time , the information would travel to cerebral regions more influenced byemotions and cultural contexts , which could cause distortions in relation to the evaluation of the computer .
According to Dr. Costa , this detail does not invalidate a possible application of the experiment , above all for the evaluation of visual content that must provoke an impact or an immediate liking , such as billboards , Internet pages or even television ads .
" One of the benefits of this research is the identification of thespecific importance of various visual attributes in the process of perception . "
Presently , the São Carlos group is working on a program for the semi-automatic diagnosis of leukemia , in collaboration with the hematologists Dr. Marco Zago , of the School of Medicine of USP in Ribeirão Preto , and Dr. Sérgio Martins , of the Hemocenter also in Ribeirão Preto .
The objective is to create software to support the doctor in the process of recognition of abnormal cells , distinctive through the alteration of their format .
Today , the diagnosis is made visually - and rather subjectively .
Dr. Costa believes that the diagnosis not only will be quicker but will also be more precise and objective .
For this reason , it seems to be possible to swiftly relate the shape of the cell with a type of illness and checking the result with the clinical data , make decisions even more precise regarding the form of treatment .
Recently the São Carlos group joined the Human Cancer Genome Project .
One of their tasks , already defined , is to apply processing of signals and images techniques , recognition of patterns , artificial intelligence and the digging out of data in the analysis of the information obtained in this project , financed jointly by FAPESP and the Ludwig Institute .
Part of this eight-year tread is gathered into the recently launchedShape Analysis and Classification : Theory and Practice , written by Dr. Costa in partnership with Dr. Roberto Marcondes César Jr . , of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of USP of São Paulo , at the invitation of the North American publishing house CRC Press .
Looking to the future , the two researchers now intend to advance in the research of cybernetic vision with applications in the analysis of microscope images , visual inspection and the recognition of faces , through thematic projects recently signed up and to be developed over the next three years .

In the search of lost knowledge
Research recovers the evolution of the scientific ideas of Portugal and of Brazil
What scientific and technical thinking of the Portuguese and the Brazilians like in the Renaissance ?
" At first I thought that there would be less than one thousand scientific books published in Portugal and in Brazil before 1822 and the project , in the first instant , was only going to go up to the Independence of Brazil . "
" From that period there are , actually , 7,000 books . "
To his surprise , up to this moment the researcher and his team of six people have already registered more than 80,000 items , during a period of research that was enlarged from the Renaissance up until 1900 .
The work is not yet concluded , and according to the calculations of professor Martins , could be end up cataloguing more than 100,000 publications that , afterwards , will be placed on and available through the Internet .
" Obviously , we need to include the scientific and technical history of Portugal . "
The researcher observes that , contrary to the more developed countries , in Brazil and in Portugal there is a blank when one tries to know what type of scientific information went around in that rich historical period .
" It is very easy to discover what was published in magazines of the more developed countries during the 19th century about any theme of physics for example , using the bibliographical elements in existence . "
Ample research
The survey carried out by the team from Unicamp is broad .
There are primary and secondary documents about all of the scientific questions - medicine , chemistry , and pharmaceutical zoology , veterinary , anthropology , astronomy , navigation and military arts , just to name a few .
They only looked for the works of Portuguese and Brazilian authors , unpublished or published in another country or in another language .
The works of foreigners about Portugal and Brazil were kept out and as well as references about fiction literature , judicial , religious and speeches .
However , there is an exception among the religious texts .
It is the translation of the Gospel carried out by the Portuguese for the Chinese and the Japanese in the 16th century .
When you add to the 7,000 books published from the 15th century until 1822 , maps , manuscripts and articles from magazines and the references about that period the number goes up to 20,000 items .
This explains why they did not proceed with the research into the 20th century .
" From that point onwards the number of publications explodes and it would be an insane piece of work . "
" We found interesting phases of scientific production that determined the degree of publications related with the historical period of the time . "
" For example , around 1760 , with the reform of Marquis of Pombo and the expulsion of the Jesuits in Portugal , the educational system was changed . "
A lack of global studies
This work is unprecedented and will certainly facilitate the life of researchers on any of the genres catalogued .
In Brazil , up until now , there are few studies and normally they are about specific questions .
For example , there are the old global studies edited by Fernando de Azevedo and by Mário Guimarães Ferri and Shozo Motoyama .
More recently , the history groups of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and of Geosciences of Unicamp carried out studies about the development of some important institutions in the 19th century .
There are also studies about chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries and about the history of mathematics .
The Oswaldo Cruz Hospital has carried out a piece of research into sources of medicines .
The Museum of Astronomy and Related Sciences took a survey of the archives in Rio de Janeiro .
The researcher informs that in Portugal the situation is not much different , though there is a longer tradition of studies about the history of science and of technical developments .
It is not an easy task to research , to gather together and to organize these thousands of bibliographical references .
The work of the team from Unicamp consists in searching for information both in printed reference works ( such as bibliographies , catalogues , historic studies ) and in direct consultation to libraries and archives .
Firstly , they use works found through bibliographies and consulting the card indexes of the libraries or in citations found in other works .
Afterwards , they look for each one of the items selected in the data bank to check if it was not already registered .
If it is not , a new registry is created and the information is fed in .
Precarious material
Meantime , the greatest difficulty is to handle all of this material , given the precarious state in which the libraries of the country are .
Professor Andrade Martins recalls , for example , that the National Library of Rio de Janeiro guards a truly historical treasure .
" However , a lot of the material has deteriorated , attacked by insects and termites . "
The researchers of Unicamp don 't have to move to Portugal to consult their archives , the work is done by way of the analysis of the catalogues of the institution .
However , professor Martins says that at the end of the 19th century , an inventory in the National Library of Lisbon was carried out on all of the material .
" We plan to make a copy of this material , as it is still the best source of information about the old material of the National Library of Lisbon . "
Even so , professor Martins found some precious items in the National Library of Rio de Janeiro that apparently do not exist in Portugal .
The Library of Rio possesses three examples of this work , one of them from the Royal Library which was brought to Brazil when the Portuguese Royal Family fled to the country in 1808 .
As well as these examples , according to the researcher , it is known that there is another at Harvard University .
Another work from that library that merits citing , according to professor Martins , isDe Regimine Cibi At que Potus , et de Caeterarum Rerum Non Naturalium Usu Nova Enarratio ( New Narrative About the Diet of Food and Drink , and of the Use of Other Non Natural Things ) , by Henrique Jorge Henriques , printed in Salamanca ( Spain ) in1594 - it is worth observing that , at that time , Portugal still found itself under the domination of the Spanish crown .
Other examples cited by the researcher are among the most important works found in the research of the 16th century .
" But we could have cited more examples , such as the philosophical theses of the 18th century , collected by Diogo Barbosa-Machado , many of which only exist in Rio . "
He figures , with the inclusion of all of the research material on the Internet , the project will only be completed in 2005 .

The traps for reality
Studies analyze what are the social relations in the works of Clarice Lispector
The texts of Clarice Lispector ( 1920-1977 ) provide vast material for enjoyment by both the formalists and the contentists , but the critical reception , as a rule , has tended to analyze the form of the social aspects .
Running contrary to this line , are the doctorate theses of Luiz Antonio Magalhães , Commonplace and Perception in Clarice Lispector , and of Maria Angela Bacellar , Clarice Lispector and the Figurations of Women , projects financed by FAPESP .
If all of the work of Clarice is a " romance of existential education " ( term of the critic Alfredo Bosi ) , and the word is important for an understanding of her complexes and abstract writings , this is not the whole story .
" The study of the social relations was not totally explored by the critics .
To observe these characters and to elaborate the script of a full-length film that privileges the thesis was the challenge of Maria Angela Bacellar , a researcher in the area of cinema at the School of Communications and Arts of the University of São Paulo ( ECA-USP ) .
" The storyteller Clarice is of extreme modernism and consciousness , and not to cover this aspect in the cinema is to deny a significant part of the revolution of the writer . "
she observes.The first challenge of the two researchers was to select the corpus of the work .
Clarice left a vast amount of work , which covers romances , short stories and chronicles , children 's books .
Dr. Magalhães decided to expand his research beyond the volume of short storiesLaços de Família ( Families Ties ) .
He analyzed the romanceA Maçã no Escuro ( Apple in the Dark ) , but , here and there , makes reference to other texts such as those ofFelicidade Clandestina ( Clandestine Happiness ) , Onde Estiveste de Noite ?
( Where Was I at night ) , A Hora da Estrela ( The Hour of the Star ) , A Paixão Segundo G.H .
InA Hora da Estrela , ( The Hour of the Star ) a book published in 1977 , we have the main character Macabéa .
The needs of the character are total : she is described as ugly ; neither white nor black but brownish ; she has TB ; from the poor northeast living in Rio de Janeiro .
According to the story teller , she was " an incompetent for life , " " so young and already rusty . "
Macabéa centers within herself economic , physical and intellectual poverty .
This context of misery appears to be more than enough to give incentive to a social reading , but this is a trap that Dr. Magalhães wants to avoid .
Magalhães and Maria Angela , followed the critical advice of Master Antonio Candido : the social aspect must not be taken outside , externalized , but taken as a factor of the artistic construction itself .
" Dogmatic proselytizing is lamentable in any sphere , above all in literature , whose function is to filter the skies of ideological dust as much as possible .
I don 't discard the critical feminist , who tries to analyze the presence of feminist figures , so remarkable in Clarice 's works .
However , at times , I agree that there is exaggeration . "
Clarice in the movies
For Dr. Magalhães , the movie adaptations of the works of Clarice tend towards a reality bias .
Though he praises the version ofA Hora da Estrela ( The hour of the Star ) , at the hands of Suzana Amaral because of the beautiful and sensitive interpretations , Dr. Magalhães has some misgivings .
" It is difficult not to perceive when the work loses in complexity and density with the elimination of the narrator , Rodrigo SM , and of his clash with the language and life , the language as a moment of life and death . "
The researcher Maria Angela Bacellar agrees with Luiz Antonio Magalhães on the point that erasing the narrator oversimplifies the script .
" By not facing the question of the narrator , an option is made for conventional cinema , even classic .
" There are market pressures that inhibit an alternative treatment of the movie language .
It loses a lot with this , because Clarice is before everything else a modern , inciting writer .
To fill this gap , Dr. Maria Angela says that she is writing a script for a film " outside of the market and of whatever type of convention . "
In the project , she is intends to make screenplays of ten stories by Clarice Lispector that represent women as lead figure .
What brings together so many stories are the female profiles .
Dr. Maria Angela had already worked with movie adaptations in her dissertation for her masters thesis , The Key - An Adaptation for the Cinema Based on Three Stories by Lygia Fagundes Telles , defended in 1995 at ECA-USP .
However , she felt that the greater challenge was that of making an intersemiotic translation of a more complex work such as that of Clarice .
Before entering into the scripts proper , Dr. Maria Angela carried out a meticulous study of some of the intersemiotic translations of literature for the cinema , such as : A Hora da Estrela - The Hour of the Star by Suzana Amaral , O Corpo - The Body by José Antonio Garcia , andClandestina Felicidade - Clandestine Happiness , a short film by Marcelo Gomes .
Would it be possible to give an account of the internal feelings of the personalities only through visual resources ?
To help to reach this state , the researcher has used , above all , in the modern theorizations of the writer and theorist Gérard Gennete and found her inspiration in various productions by Ingmar Bergman .
" His films are cinema in the pure state . "
Mysteries of Clarice
Did the obsession of Clarice for the theme of family relations had to do with her own experience of life , of her Russian and Jewish roots , but in love with the Brazilian North East ?
As the biographies report , Clarice Lispector was born in Tchetchelnik , Ukraine ( ex-USSR ) , in 1920 .
" A town so insignificant that it does not even feature on the map . "
As a newly born , she came to Brazil with her parents who settled down in Recife .
In 1934 the family moved to Rio de Janeiro , where Clarice did her secondary and preparatory schooling .
Already during her time at the National School of Law of the University of Brazil , she caused confusion with her first romance , Perto do Coração Selvagem - Near the Wild Heart , refused at that time by the editor José Olympio .
She published it the following year through the publishing house A Noite and received the Graça Aranha Award .
In 1944 , she went with her husband to Naples where she helped in a hospital looking after Brazilian soldiers who had joined the Brazilian Expeditionary Force .
On her return to Brazil she wroteO Lustre - The Lamp , published in1946 .
After long stays in Switzerland and the United States , the writer settled down in Rio where she stayed until her death .
Does this mixture of places , religious origins , influences , a suffered loss of her mother when she was nine years of age , the worldwide trips with her diplomat husband , this itinerant life influence her work in which the theme of family comes up obsessively ?
" No doubt the answer is yes .
The movement that perhaps had come from the structuralism of erasing the presence of the author had already been reversed .
The process of understanding the real author can help a lot in understanding the work itself , what is within it and what is surrounding it . "
However , the researcher advises of the dangers of these crossed wires between author / life / work .
The risk is to fall into biographism , to explain the work through events in the life of the author .
" Absurd ideas were put forward in the past , such as to propose that the fictional diction of Machado de Assis came from his speech defect or the conclusion that Augusto dos Anjos must have been a potential murderer to have written what he wrote . "
A reinvented life
Dr. Magalhães says that to write something new about Clarice Lispector , one of the most studied authors of our literature , is a challenge proportional to the work .
The critic points out the necessity of democratizing the texts of Clarice and of re-reading them from new angles , above all in a time of globalization .
" A rich and plural work such as that of Clarice always has something to give because it engenders and disseminates feelings that allow for an enormous range of exploration .
It serves both to interpret the disenchantment of the process of globalization today , and for this world founded on a type of rationality that represses aspects such as sensuality and sensibility , contrary to logic . "
At the moment Maria Angela Bacellar is finishing up the screenplays .
Could it be that we will have new adaptations of the work of Clarice in the cinema ?
