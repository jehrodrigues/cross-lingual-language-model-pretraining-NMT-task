Results from the first transplants using stem cells in Brazil usher in the prospect of using this technique against cardiac arrest , one of the main causes of death in the world
Ricardo Zorzetto
These are the stem cells , intensely studied over the last five years because of their fantastic peculiarity : that of multiplying themselves and ending up as the cells of the different body tissues , as distinct as those of the skin , muscle and the nervous system .
In Brazil , results from at least three research groups have come out which , in parallel with European and North American teams , consolidate the stem cells as an option for -- if not a cure -- at least improving the quality of life of people with serious heart problems , against which medicines no longer produce the desired effects .
Using distinct techniques , researchers from the States of Rio de Janeiro , Bahia and São Paulo have concluded that the transplanting of stem cells is a promising alternative against chronic cardiac insufficiency brought on by hypertension , obstruction of the coronary arteries and by Chagas 's disease .
A problem in which the heart progressively loses its capacity to pump blood , cardiac insufficiency hits between 3 % and 6 % of the world 's population , and in Brazil between five to ten million people .
The team from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) and the Pro-Cardiac Hospital , which published the most advanced data , recently obtained an international triumph for their results which they arrived at after two year 's work , a short period of time when dealing with a new area worldwide .
On the 13th of May , the magazineCirculation , the most important scientific magazine dealing with clinical cardiology , published an article in which the researchers from Rio describe the first transplants using stem cells in sufferers from chronic cardiac insufficiency .
Of the fourteen patients treated , twelve are doing well and two have died , apparently through causes not linked to the use of the stem cells , according to the doctors .
" The project only went so quickly because we had already had at the UFRJ a model for transplant in rats when we initiated the study , " recognizes the cardiologist Hans Dohmann , from the Pro-Cardiac Hospital .
" The impression is that the totipotent use substitute the fibrous tissue for muscular cells , " comments Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho from UFRJ , which works with the Millennium Institute of Tissue Bioengineering , supported by the federal government .
This treatment increases the irrigation of the injured part of the heart , allowing the cells that have entered into a type hibernation to return to contracting themselves .
At the same time a group from the Heart Institute ( Incor ) and the School of Medicine of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) applied these cells in nine patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency caused by hypertension , Chagas 's disease or of unknown origin .
Four months afterwards three were no longer on the list for heart transplants , five improved considerably and one died , death being attributed to the serious state of health the patient before entering into the experiment .
" Looking at the as yet restricted number of patients , it is early to talk confidently about the efficiency of these techniques , " comments the cardiologist Edimar Bocchi from USP , one of the research coordinators .
" But the results point to the prospect of improvement for these people who have an extremely serious illness . "
In practical terms , the teams from Rio and São Paulo have maintained beating -- with a good part of their previous vigor -- the hearts of men and women who could no longer walk in the morning to the baker 's shop nor feed themselves , such was the dimension of the tiredness brought on by cardiac insufficiency .
Before the treatment with stem cells , the only solution for them was to wait for months for a heart transplant .
If they managed to resist , they would confront surgery that begins with a cut of some thirty centimeters in the thorax , finishes some nine hours later , demands a month for recovery , and in total the bill runs up to R $ 200,000 .
The implanting of stem cells is much simpler .
During this month , Santos in partnership with cardiologists from the Santa Izabel Hospital , also in the State capital of Bahia , intends to begin a study with five patients suffering from cardiac insufficiency caused by Chagas 's disease , the illness brought on by the protozoaTrypanosoma cruzi , the parasite that lodges in the cells of the heart .
In recent research , Santos demonstrated that the use of this type of cell reduces in a long-standing manner the inflamed and damaged areas of the heart of mice with Chagas 's disease .
This could be a way of keeping the health heart free of trouble so that under these circumstances the parasite , which causes an illness that affects sixteen million people in Latin America of who six million are Brazilians , can then be fought against .
Only at the beginning
Even with these results some years will still be necessary before this type of treatment becomes available to the population both in the public and private health systems .
The experiments are merely the start of a long trajectory until the approval of new medicines or medical procedures for human beings .
This is called phase 1 of clinical studies objective of which is to investigate if the treatment is safe and does not cause any serious side effects .
This is followed by other stages in which the efficiency of the treatment in tens and then thousands of patients are analyzed .
The Brazilian researchers are by-passing the ethical questions associated with the use of these cells because they are working with only one of the two types in existence .
They are using adult stem cells , produced by the bone marrow of the individual himself that he will later receive in the transplant .
In this manner , they are avoiding the controversial question surrounding the use of the other type of stem cells , the embryonic stem cells , so-called because they are removed from embryos with only a few days of life .
This is exactly the reason for the controversy as the embryo dies when the cells are extracted .
More versatile than the adult cells , the embryonic stem cells are capable of originating all types of body cells .
For this reason , countries with legislation considered to be more liberal , such as Britain , have limited research to the cells removed from embryos discarded in the treatment of assisted fertilization .
Nobody can also forget the more conservative attitude adopted by the President of the United States , George W. Bush , who has restricted federal financing only to studies with sixty two strains of embryonic stem cells already characterized in the laboratory .
In a situation in which the scientific result receives help by accident , the project of the implanting of stem cells in the heart was born from a solution in search of a problem .
During 2000 , Hans Dohmann , from the Pro-Cardiac Hospital in Rio , had been working with the Brazilian cardiologist Emerson Perin at the Texas Heart Institute , building a special catheter using a fine needle and sensors capable of identifying the dead portions of the heart .
In this same year , they got to know at a meeting in Hamburg , Germany , that another team had completed the catheter before them .
It was at that point that the specialists recognized that the gadget could be used in research with stem cells .
" On the plane coming back to Rio , I was imagining that we would need cooperation with foreign teams in the case I decided to get involved in this area , " recalls Dohmann .
By chance he had fooled himself .
In Rio , Radovan Borojevic and Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho , both from UFRJ , had initiated a study on the application of stem cells to mice with artificially brought on cardiac insufficiency .
This is something similar to what is observed when there is an accumulation of fatty tissue in the coronary arteries that diminishes the flow of blood to the heart .
This reduction kills some areas of the heart , which then stops pumping blood in an efficient manner to the body .
In an attempt to compensate for the lack of force , the heart increases in size , reaching double the normal in the most serious cases , as it can be seen on page 35 .
The green light for the work came through in October of 2001 , five months after Carvalho and Borojevic had verified in mice that the stem cells incorporated themselves into the heart muscle , and , even more importantly , restored , at least in part , its capacity to self-contract .
" There are as yet no detailed studies that explain what is happening , " comments Carvalho .
Little by little the researchers from Rio demonstrated , in a pioneering manner , that this type of cellular therapy re-establishes the pumping of the blood by the heart in the most complicated cases of cardiac insufficiency , in which the problem turns chronic and the patient feels fine only when he is sitting down .
Under these conditions , the medicines that impede the increase of the size of the heart -- such as beta-blockers and the inhibitors for the angiotensin converting enzyme -- stop producing the desired effect .
In some cases , it also becomes impossible to treat the disease using traditional therapies such as angioplasty , the introduction of a catheter with a balloon on the tip , which squashes the plaques of fat , or the implant of a bridge , a way of detouring the blocked area by using veins removed from the leg or the pectoral region .
In the most severe cases , cardiac insufficiency kills half of the patients in six months .
Before this Brazilian study , Bodo Strauer , from the University of Düsseldorf , in Germany , had published in September of 2002 in theCirculation magazine an article in which he described an increase in the blood flow rate of the heart in patients who had received applications of stem cells .
However , the study took into consideration only people who had suffered acute heart attacks and where part of the heart had remained close to a week without an adequate supply of blood .
Furthermore , the capacity of these patients to pump blood was higher than the one shown by the Brazilians -- which made their recovery simpler than when the problem became chronic .
With the approval of Conep , Dohmann and Perin selected their twenty-one volunteers who were integrated into the initial phase of the clinical study .
Each person who was submitted to the therapy with stem cells passed through the same procedure : by way of a small cut in the highest portion of the hip , the doctors introduced a needle into the ilium bone , which forms the bulging sides of the pelvis , and they extracted 50 ml of material drawn from the bone marrow .
This viscous and dark red colored liquid consists of a mixture of cells , very rich in adult stem cells that are afterwards separated in the laboratory .
Back in the surgery theater four hours later , Dohmann and Perin had in their hands a red concentrate of live stem cells .
With the catheter , thirty million of them were injected into the internal wall of the left ventricle -- the most important of the four heart chambers , which pumps blood rich in oxygen to the body .
They applied the stem cells in the areas in which the cardiac muscle had gone into a type of hibernation -- inactive although still alive .
Four months afterwards it was noted that the transplant had stimulated the appearance of small arteries in the region of the heart that had lost the capacity to self-contract .
With the improvement in the blood flow rate , the area that is short of blood decreased by 73 % and the capacity to pump from the heart increased from 20 % to 29 % , sufficient to allow that the transplanted patients increased from five to seven minutes their time for slow steps on a treadmill .
The doctors have compared the quality of life of the people who received the stem cells before the treatment and six months after the application .
On average , they found them the same as or better than Americans of the same age .
The seven members of the control group who took only medicine against cardiac insufficiency did not present any relevant improvement in the condition of their health during the same period .
According to Dohmann , they should also receive the implantation of stem cells , possibly starting in August .
In a second phase of this study , forecast to begin at the end of this year , the researchers from Rio de Janeiro intend to analyze the performance of this technique in a larger group composed of one hundred and twenty patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency .
Cellular reinforcement
In Sao Paulo the cardiologists Edimar Bocchi and Dalton Chamone have also verified an increase in the force of the heartbeat , restored by techniques distinct from the treatment with stem cells .
Instead of extracting these cells directly from the bone and injecting them into the cardiac muscle , Bocchi and Chamone were able to count upon the collaboration of the organism itself .
When they reach a certain concentration the doctors sent the transplant candidates for a series of blood filtering to separate out the stem cells which were then frozen and stored before being once again injected into the bloodstream .
Of the nine patients between the ages of thirty-three and sixty-five , two received injections of stem cells into their coronary arteries by way of a catheter .
The other seven only injections of GM-CSF -- and all of the remaining work had to be done by the organism itself .
It is believed that the damaged tissue , like that of the injured heart , exercises a type of chemical attraction on the stem cells through the release of proteins that spur the communication between cells , such as the interleukin 6 and the Human Tumor necrosis factor-alpha .
It was not only the methods that varied .
The people treated at Incor had cardiac insufficiency caused not by blocking of the veins but by causes as varied as Chagas 's disease , increase of blood pressure ( hypertension ) or even an increase in the size of the heart without any known reason -- an infirmity known in medical jargon as idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy .
In a general manner , the capacity to pump blood and the oxygen intake increased and three patients had their names taken off the heart transplant list .
Today they are only taking the medicine needed to control cardiac insufficiency .
Two of them still present a problem that normally reaches 20 % of cardiac insufficiency sufferers : the blocking by coagulant blood of the artery that leads the blood poor in oxygen to the lungs .
" An apparent small increase in the capacity to pump blood many times represents a significant improvement for the patients , " Bocchi explains .
After getting into the blood stream , the parasite that causes the disease , the protozoa namedTrypanosoma cruzi , lodges in the interior of the cardiac cells , which sets off an alert to the immune system .
But the parasite is not the only one that loses .
The heart cells have on their surface proteins similar to those of trypanosome and for this reason they also suffer an attack from the defense cells .
As a consequence , thousands of scars appear throughout the organ .
An aggravation to the problem is that infection by the trypanosome is more frequent in the population of rural areas , especially in the North and Northeast Regions in which there are no heart transplant programs .
Stem cells could alleviate this problem .
In mice , as Santos verified , one only needs to give an injection of 20 million stems cells associated to the use of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor , the GM-CSF , in order to reduce the inflammation and the fibrous tissue of the heart .
After two months , the mice treated using this method showed 80 % fewer inflamed cells and fibrous tissue than the mice that had not received this therapy .
The most important aspect is that this benefit seems to be long lasting : the improvement persisted for six months after the mice received the stem cells , a period equivalent to almost twenty years for human beings .
In a recently approved experiment by Conep , Santos is going to inject 30 million of these cells into the interior of the coronary arteries , as well as GM-CSF , initially in five patients with cardiac insufficiency caused by Chagas 's disease .
If the technique shows itself to be secure , the researcher from Fiocruz will widen and detail the study with a further twenty-five patients -- five should receive stem cells and GM-CSF , ten will be treated only with stem cells and ten with medicine .
" Using this therapy we hope to reduce the lesions on the heart to the minimal level , similar to those that occur with 70 % of the carriers of Chagas 's disease who do not develop cardiac insufficiency , " says Santos .
If a success , the treatment will allow that the doctors can give to the patients a medicine to combat the protozoa , named benznidazole , which , as it is toxic , cannot be used with people suffering from cardiac insufficiency .

Virtual opportunity
The Tidia Program will select projects concerning the infrastructure of the network and distance learning
FAPESP is launching a tender for the registration of research groups into the Information Technology for the Development of the Advanced Internet Program ( Tidia ) .
Established in 2001 , the program aims to stimulate research into new technologies for the Internet , offering the necessary optical fiber infrastructure for carrying out tests on hardware equipment , the development of software and the creation of digital academic content , with emphasis on distance learning .
" We are going to make available a high speed optical fiber network to make possible experiments which , carried out in the laboratory , might not reflect the behavior of the technologies in the real world , " comments Luis Fernandez Lopes , the president of Tidia 's coordinating commission .
The program , which is based on the cooperation between research centers and anticipates partnerships with business and the government , has three large areas : the infrastructure of the network , known as the test bed , incubator of digital content and distance learning ( e-learning ) .
In the first , the researchers can make use of switched off optical fibers , that is , inactive , for tests .
" For example , the network could serve as a test field to evaluate equipment for the broadening of transmission bands or a communication protocol , " observes Hugo Fragnito , Tidia 's coordinator in the area of infrastructure .
Democratizing access
The second area of research included in the program anticipates support for research in the development of software and academic content , benefiting projects on digitalizing libraries , among others .
" The production of didactic material that could be accessed from any location and at any moment demands an enormous effort in standardization and a lot of care to make sure of good interactivity , flexibility and ease of use , " comments Wilson Vicente Ruggiero , Tidia 's coordinator in the area of distance learning .
All of the tools used in the projects will have open code , or that is to say , will allow for correction and control of application .
FAPESP is beginning to sign agreements with telecommunication service providers so as to offer to researchers a network of switched off optical fiber , linking , in the first instance Sao Paulo , Campinas and São Carlos , at a velocity of 400 gigabits per second .
To have an idea of what this means , it is worth recalling that the connections in domestic wide band operate at velocities varying between 256 kilobits and 2 megabits per second .

Team from the state of Minas Gerais discover a network of tubes that store calcium in the nucleus of cells
One single piece of research knocks down two myths at the same time .
The first : in the nucleus of cells there isn 't just the chromosomes , made up of proteins and DNA , as it was thought for at least fifty years .
Within there is also , as the Brazilian and American researchers have discovered , a network of tubes that store calcium -- a chemical element essential for the working of the cell .
" This is the first time that anyone has shown that the nucleus contains its own organelles , " comments Maria de Fátima Leite , a researcher at the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) and the co-author of this work , published on the 22nd of April in the on-line edition ofNature Cell Biology .
Maria de Fátima and Michael Nathanson , from Yale University in the United States , have verified that such organelles -- or compartments called endoplamastic reticulum -- at least occur in liver cells .
" It is probable that the cells of the heart , muscles and nervous system also possess this structure , " she adds .
The second undone idea is that the nucleus will receive calcium only from the cytoplasm , the gelatinous portion that occupies the space between the nucleus and the cell 's external membrane .
It is in the cytoplasm that compartments with various functions are found , an example being the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum , a type of bag that entraps the calcium .
The team 's finding suggests that it is possible that the calcium passed through the membrane of the nucleus but there is no longer any way of denying the self-sufficiency of the nucleus regarding this chemical element , essential in regulating muscular contraction , in heart beating , in hormones secretion , in cell multiplication and differentiation and in the so-called neuronal plasticity -- the capacity of the brain to create alternative routes to maintain the body functioning or to rescue memory .
In the nucleus , the calcium could also change the structure of the DNA molecule , and activate or deactivate genes .
Cited in the section Editors ' Choice of the magazineScience of the 9th of May , the paper by the researchers from UFMG and Yale helps to understand how one single chemical element -- even though it is abundant in the interior of the cells -- can manage to regulate so many cellular functions .
The calcium is released selectively -- only when the endoplamastic reticulum is activated -- and thus determines one or other answer from the nucleus .
Afterwards , conducted by transporting molecules , the calcium makes the return trip : again cuts across the pores of the membrane of the network of tubes and remains lodged within until it will be requested once again .
" If it remains free in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm , " Maria de Fátima says , " the calcium will set off a series of chemical reactions that could lead to the death of the cell . "
In order to discover the depositories of the calcium , the researchers used proteins that work as fluorescent probes that , through chemical affinity , adhere to the endoplasmatic reticulum .
They only arrived at these conclusions and saw the calcium depositories of the nucleus because they made use of a two photon microscope , which , besides the very high resolution , causes less damage to the cells than using other techniques .
There is very little of this type of equipment in the world -- one of them is in Nathanson 's laboratory , with whom the Brazilian researcher began to collaborate some two years ago .
The work that they carried out together does not only suggest alterations in textbooks , in which the nucleus appears with the only space being for the chromosomes .
It will also affect research for medicines -- such as those used against hypertension or in the regeneration of the liver -- whose side effects might be minimized with a measure that acts in a more precise manner on the calcium of the nucleus or on the cytoplasm of the cells .

On the trail of a vaccine
Brazilians sequence the genome of the bacterium that causes leptospirosis and request patents for twenty-four proteins
Marcos Pivetta
Anyone who has read the issue of the 24th of April of the British magazineNature , one of the most influential scientific publications , verified that a team from the Chinese Human Genome Center of Shanghai , had sequenced the complete genome of the Lai strain ofLeptospira interrrogans , the most common of the bacteria that causes leptospirosis in that country .
Transmitted to man by the urine of rats and other animals infected with the pathogen , leptospirosis is considered the most widespread of the zoonoses , the diseasesthat animals transmit to human beings , especially in rural areas with a humid climate .
Carried out by scientists from a developing nation outside of the axis Europe--United States , the work of the Asian group was , without a doubt , of international relevance .
But for the Brazilians the most important news about leptospirosis does not come from the Far East nor arrive via the pages of some publication -- and has been , until now kept in silence .
Working with discretion on a project in competition to the Chinese work , a research team from the Butantan Institute of Sao Paulo , with collaboration from colleagues at the branch of the Osvaldo Cruz Foundation ( Fiocruz ) in the state of Bahia and with São Paulo universities , have also terminated the complete sequencing of another lineage ofL .
interrogans , known as serovar Copenhageni , responsible for the majority of human cases of the diseases in Brazil .
Integrated research
In reality , the Brazilian group did more than simply unmask the molecular structure of a pathogen similar to that mapped by the scientists from Shanghai .
They also took a sure step towards strengthening a promising line of research with the goal of developing better forms of prophylaxis and diagnosis of human leptospirosis , the project 's main goal .
This is because in February 2002 , one year and two months before the Chinese had published their article inNature , the Butantan scientists had requested , in the United States , the patents for twenty four genes -- and their respective proteins -- identified during the work on sequencing and analysis of the genome of serovar Copenhageni , carried out by the AEG , the public network of São Paulo laboratories that specialize in genomes concerning agronomy and the environment .
" These proteins could be useful for the development of a vaccine against human leptospirosis ( today there is none ) or for more efficient tests for the diagnosis of different serological forms of the illness , " says Ana Lucia Tabet Oller do Nascimento , from Butantan , the coordinator of the project onL .
interrogans , which was funded by FAPESP .
Such a hypothesis is based on preliminary tests in the laboratory that have shown that this group of twenty four proteins react on contact with the blood serum of people or rats infected with leptospirosis .
The reply to the patent request , whose rights extend to Brazil , should come out next year .
Comparative study
The Butantan researchers have just completed a scientific paper comparing the genomes of the two varieties ofL .
interrogans .
Much of the information on the work , which was submitted to a large international magazine and is awaiting the green light for publication , is still confidential .
However , some general data , results of this comparison , can already be released .
The two genetic sequences show themselves to be almost the same size .
The serovar Lai has almost 4.7 million pairs of bases ( the chemical units that make up the genetic code ) , divided in two circular chromosomes , one large and the other small .
The serovar Copenhageni shows an almost analogous structure , also with two chromosomes , only that they represent around 60,000 fewer pairs of bases than the strain studied by the Asian group .
The greatest difference between the two strains is regarding to their probable number of genes and respective proteins .
In their study , the Chinese counted some 4,727 genes and a similar number of proteins in the serovar Lai .
Working with the serovar Copenhageni , the Brazilians counted around 3,700 genes or proteins .
This is a considerable difference for two genomes apparently so close to each other .
" We do not believe that there are so many more proteins in the Lai in relation to the Copenhageni , " declares the biochemist Elizabeth Angélica Leme Martins , from the Butantan Institute , and an assistant on the project .
" By our analysis , this number difference should be a lot lower , around 200 proteins . "
Another contribution from the Butantan team , which also was able to count upon the participation of Paulo Lee Ho and Luciana Leite , was the discovery of 250 new proteins on the surface of serovar Copenhageni .
These proteins stay on the membrane of the cells of the pathogen and are in direct contact with the host , man or animal infected byL .
interrogans .
Among this group of proteins , a smaller group of 174 lipoproteins stand out , these could have greater involvement in the process of infection caused by the bacterium .
" Before our work began , only ten lipoproteins had been identified onL .
interrogans , " says Ana Lucia .
" The Chinese described only a few proteins of this type . "
In the towns
Differently from serovar Lai , typical of the flooded rice plantations of Asia , the platform for a large part of the occurrence of the illness in China , the Copenhageni strain is the one that is principally responsible for the incidences of human leptospirosis in Brazil , where there have been a little more than 46,000 confirmed cases between 1987 and 2001 , with an annual death rate of from 6.5 % to 20 % of those infected .
Here , instead of being a problem associated with open fields , the illness has a more metropolitan character .
In towns people usually catch the disease in areas without basic sanitation , with accumulated garbage ( which attracts rats ) and with open sewage , or during the time of the summer floods when the public roads transform themselves into dirty streams and increase the risk of contact with water or earth contaminated with the urine of rats infected by the bacterium .
The sewage rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) , an inhabitant almost as urban as modern man himself , is the main host for serovar Copenhageni ofL .
interrogans .
Once infected , a person can take from two to thirty days to develop the most common symptoms coming from the presence of the bacterium in his organism : fever , headache , shivers , vomiting , nausea and general ill-feeling .
If it is not treated with antibiotics , normally penicillin or doxycycline , theL .
interrogans can affect the kidneys and liver , and in extreme cases , lead to death .
As its clinical manifestations don 't differ much from the symptoms unchained by other known illnesses such as dengue fever , and yellow fever , leptospirosis is often mistaken for other illnesses .
In order to reach at a diagnosis with the minimum degree of confidence , it is necessary to carry out laboratory tests using blood or urine samples from the suspected case .
" At times , even with these examinations , one will not manage to say exactly which serovar is responsible for the infection , " Ana Lucia comments .
It may well seem as just a detail to determine the serovar ofL .
To know the variety of the bacterium that unchains the disease in a person helps to prevent the evolution of the infection , since there are strains with varying degrees of aggression , and it is of fundamental importance for the creation of a vaccine against this disease .
This is even truer in the case of this pathogen .
There are more than 250 known serovares ofL .
interrogans , with varying degrees of common characteristics .
All of them are fine and elongated , with a spiral form , without rigid cellular walls .
" It is not possible to distinguish the varieties only by morphology , " Elizabeth explains .
The problem is that , if its physical constitution does not change according to the serovar , other parameters are a long way from being always the same or similar in the diverse forms of the bacterium .
The degree of pathogenicity , location of geographic occurrence , most common host and preferential victims ( man or other animal such as a dog , cow or rat ) can vary considerably in function of the strain ofL .
interrogans .
For example , certain forms of the bacterium ause leptospirosis only in men , others infect only animals and there also exist others that attack both .
The Copenhageni and the Lai are among the most virulent varieties ofL .
interrogans that attack the human being .
In the study of the comparison of the genomes of these two strains , the Butantan researchers believe that they identified two proteins present only in the variety sequenced in Brazil -- and involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides , a type of sugar -- that could facilitate the process of differentiating between the serovares .
" If confirmed , this piece of information could also be important for the understanding of the large antigenic variation of the Leptospirae , " forecasta Ana Lucia .
Brazilian variation
The main clinical implication of the large diversity of the pathogens responsible for leptospirosis is the existence of multiple antigens associated with the disease , each one of them literally different from the others .
Any substance recognized by the organism as of external origin or capable of offering danger to it is called an antigen .
To defend against this potential aggressive agent , normally one or more proteins , the immunological system produces specific defenses ( antibodies ) against the antigen that is threatening it .
In the case of leptospirosis , due to the high number of serovares of the bacteria that causes the illness , to have antibodies against a variety ofL .
interrogans does not necessarily confer protection against the other forms of the pathogen .
In an ideal scenario , the perfect vaccine against leptospirosis would confer immunological protection against all of the forms of the bacterium , or at least those most disseminated .
Nevertheless , the maximum that can be obtained in many cases is a more focused and specific product , capable of impeding the infection brought on by one or another type of serovares and that shows itself innocuous to the other forms of the pathogen .
The countries that are deeply researching into leptospirosis , which are few , tend to focus their work on the most important local varieties .
Besides China and Brazil , that have sequenced distinct varieties ofL .
interrogans , the Australians are studying the genetic material of another strain of this bacterium .
" We have to carry out our very own research with the serovar Copenhageni , which is the major cause of human leptospirosis in Brazil , since nothing guarantees that a vaccine developed abroad , against another variety of the bacterium , will also be useful for us , " emphasizes Ana Lucia .
If the clues that the Brazilian researchers have picked up are shown to be correct and everything runs to plan , a form of immunization against the illness could become a reality in five to ten years time .
To speed up the process , partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry and researchers in the veterinary area , who are also interested in new therapies against leptospirosis , are one of the priorities of the group from the Butantan Institute .

Under the Skin
Beauty creams stimulate more brain regions in women with sensitive skin
There is no doubt that the skin of two individuals can react -- and react effectively -- in a different manner to the application of a cream or beauty product .
Some people use enormous quantities of a cosmetic without showing any form of skin irritation .
Others , just after having put the same product on their skin , feel itching or burning at the point where they applied it .
Might looking at what is happening in the brain of individuals with sensitive skin and those with non-sensitive skin , help to better understand the problem ?
Perhaps , if one judges by the results of a recent survey .
In collaboration with the National Health and Medical research Institute ( Inserm in the Portuguese acronym ) and the Bicêtre Hospital in Paris , researchers with the company L 'Oreal , the French multinational in the cosmetics area , have demonstrated that , on entering into contact with substances known to be irritants , women with skin classified as sensitive show a standard of brain activity very different from those who have a skin that is not sensitive .
With the help of images obtained through a technique of functional magnetic resonance , capable of showing which sectors of the brain are activated by a stimulant , the authors of the study realized that the areas activated among women with sensitive skin were in greater number and distributed themselves in a manner more or less uniform between the two hemispheres .
With the participants with non-sensitive skin , the answer was much more discrete and mostly concentrated in the hemisphere opposite the region of the body to where the stimulus has occurred .
" We have the impression that the information ( referring to dermal discomfort ) arrives at the brain of all women in the same manner , but is dealt with in a different way according to the context , to the sensitivity of the skin , " explains the French physicist Bernard Querleux , the main author of the work and L 'Oreal 's research director , who was in Brazil last month .
Part of this study was presented at the 20th World Conference of Dermatology , which took place in Paris last year .
The brain 's responses
In his studies , Querleux and his assistants set out to determine , in an objective manner , the neural bases of sensitive skin .
It is an important line of research for the cosmetics industry , products of which are placed over the epidermis and must beautify their consumers -- and not cause them pain or discomfort .
In Europe and the United States , half of the women , the main consumer public for face creams , have skin that is more susceptible to showing undesirable reactions after the application of a cosmetic .
In China , one third suffer from the same problem .
In other parts of the world , at least 10 % of the female population have this characteristic , according to data from L 'Oreal , which invests 3 % of its yearly revenues ( something around half a billion Euros ) in their research division .
To have sensitive skin is not a rare condition , but to diagnose the problem is not always easy starting from clinical signs or from biophysical measures .
" This is a theme that still carries with it a large dose of subjectivity , " Querleux comments , " hence our interest in studying it . "
In order to see how the brain reacts when confronted with a product that is more aggressive to the epidermis , the French researchers carried out an experiment with eighteen women , of whom half said that they had sensitive skin .
On the left hand side of the face they placed droplets of an inert solution and applied to the right lactic acid , a substance normally used as an irritant in tests on dermal reactivity .
During a ten-minute period the magnetic resonance device registered the functioning of the brain of each of the women .
This type of equipment measures changes in the flow of blood and oxygen in the regions where there is a large amount of neuronal activity and generates images in which the brain areas brought into action by the stimulus are highlighted .
At the end of the experiment , even before analyzing the magnetic resonance images , the scientists had already managed to easily separate the women into two groups .
Those who showed greater discomfort on the right face where the lactic acid had been applied made up part of the group previously labeled with sensitive skin .
Those who showed less irritation on this side of their face were in the team of non-sensitive.Up until this point the study appeared to confirm the obvious : those who declared themselves to have sensitive skin suffered more from the effects of the irritant substance .
The work became more original when Querleux and his colleagues went on to evaluate the profile of the brain activation of the two groups of women .
There were some common points and evident differences .
Among the points in common that came up , there was the realization that all of the patients , with or without skin sensitivity , had shown an increase in neuronal activity in the primary sensorial cortex of the left hemisphere of the brain .
Therefore , in the patients whose right face had been exposed to a substance that causes discomfort , the registration of neuronal activity on the left of the cortex was greater than that expected .
In the end , the left hemisphere directs and feels the right side of the body and vice-versa.In the chapter dealing with the differences between the two groups of participants in the study , more interesting data came up .
In spite of the facial irritation having led all of the women to react , in both of the brain hemispheres , at two subdivisions of the cortex ( the pre-frontal and cingulate regions ) the neuronal activity registered in these subdivisions was much greater in those with sensitive skin , especially in the right side of their brain .
This data led Querleux and his colleagues to think that the pre-frontal and cingulate cortexes could be directly linked to greater sensitivity of the skin .
" We cannot forget that to have sensitive skin is to feel the lowermost level of pain , on a nano-metric scale , because of the application of a cosmetic , " says L 'Oreal 's research director .
" For this reason , the neuronal circuits of sensitive skin can also be looked upon as circuits of pain , " Querleux concludes .
Besides studying the neural bases of sensitive skin , the researchers at the cosmetics multinational developed studies destined towards increasing their understanding about touch .
In another study done with the help of functional magnetic resonance , they gathered evidence that neuronal stimulus brought about by the application of a cream in the hand of a woman seems to vary according to a basic trait of her personality .
After making use of the product , the most imaginative bring into intensive action both of the brain hemispheres .
In the case of more objective and logical women , the cerebral activity tends to concentrate in the hemisphere opposite to the hand that received the cosmetic .
For L 'Oreal , the study is providing clues about what a cream might do to the most emotive portion of the brain of people , above all those who are most sensitive .

Rich and tragic
Only 2.4 % of the natural vegetation of the Minas Gerais Triangle remain , ten times less than the minimum recommended
One of the most productive agricultural regions of the country , the Minas Gerais Triangle is beginning to pay dearly for its robust economic development over the last few decades .
The excessive felling of the natural vegetation , intensified during the 60s by the federal programs to expand agricultural frontiers , is bringing about an effect already felt by the population : a shortage of water is beginning to be felt in the growing areas and in the urban areas of Uberaba , Araguari and Ituiutaba , some of the main cities of this region of sixty four municipalities and 1.7 million inhabitants .
Of this natural vegetation , named Cerrado ( wooded savanna ) , which covered half of Minas Gerais , there remains only 2.4 % , ten times less than that required by law , according to a survey coordinated by the geographer Samuel do Carmo Lima , from the Federal University of Uberlândia ( UFU ) .
In the 54,000 km2 of one of the most rich regions of Minas Gerais , pasture and monotonous plantations of soya , corn and sugarcane predominate , in the space of the now rare sousari nut trees , sucupiras , paus-terra and other trees of up to ten meters in height , of torturous trunks , thick bark and thorny leaves , notable for their resistance to fire mixed in with the creeping vegetation and grasses .
" There is natural vegetation only in the areas of most inclined relief and in the canyons ( deep depressions between the mountains ) , " Lima explains .
Financed by the Research Support Foundation of Minas Gerais ( Fapemig ) , his survey shows that it is not only in the Triangle that the area of Cerrado is below the limit imposed by law : current Brazilian legislation calls for the conservation of 20 % of natural vegetation in rural properties and prohibits the cutting down of the vegetal cover that accompanies rivers and streams , theso-called thorny undergrowths .
In some of the other ten regions analyzed , the Cerrado has practically disappeared -- in the Valley of the Jequitinhonha river , the poorest region of Minas Gerais , there remains 0.09 % of this type of vegetation , and in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte 0.77 % .
In all of the state , the remnants of Cerrado don 't go beyond one tenth of what had existed .
" As a consequence of inadequate management and not taking care of the land , we are losing , per year , around one centimeter of the superficial layer , the most fertile of the soil , " he says .
" Erosion , besides diminishing productivity , increases the cost of agricultural production . "
Cristina Garvil , the director of the Water and Sewage Authority of the town of Ituiutaba , points to another problem : " The rural producers don 't have money to fence and reforest the lost area . "
The plans
In order to confront these problems , the Association of Municipalities of the Valley of the Parnaíba River ( Anvap ) has created a civil society organization of public interest , the Caiapônia Institute of Environmental Sanitation .
By luck , even with such a small amount of natural vegetation , the Minas Triangle is one of the regions in the state of Minas Gerais with the largest area of preserved Cerrado -- something that should help considerably in the recovery of the devastated areas .
Lima calculates that 15,000 km2 -- almost one third of the complete Triangle -- needs to be replanted so that the rural properties will exhibit the minimum natural coverage determined by law .
" We 're going to spend ten years until more consistent results begin to appear , but I 'm confident , " he says .
At an estimated cost of R $ 400,000 , the reforestation should begin during this year , giving priority to the micro basins that serve as the areas of springs for the provision of water for Uberlândia , Uberaba , Araguari , Ituiutaba and Tupaciguara , the main towns in the region .
Wire fencing should be installed in these areas to impede the invasion of cattle and to allow the natural vegetation to regenerate itself , no matter how slowly .
The areas of advanced devastation will demand prolonged work , with the creation of nurseries for the native species before reforestation .
Water table
Begun during the Colonial period , the deforestation of the Minas Triangle has always been linked to the conquest of space for cattle and agriculture .
The felling of the trees intensified , however , at the end of the 50s with the building of Brasilia , and expanded during the following decades with the federal projects for the expansion of the agricultural frontiers towards the north and northwest regions .
" The federal programs for the installation of an infrastructure and the state programs of support to the agricultural business in this region transformed the areas of Cerrado , before seen as sterile , into productive lands , " says Eduardo Nunes Guimarães , from the Economics Department of the Federal University of Uberlândia .
Agriculture really advanced -- perhaps too much .
Today there is a lack of water because even the undergrowths that protected the margins of the rivers have disappeared .
Without them , the rivers receive the earth from soil erosion and are becoming shallower .
The problem gets worse because the naked soil retains the water less intensively .
Thus , there is no way of maintaining the subterranean water reserves -- the water table , which maintains the forests , the agricultural lands and the towns .
" The Triangle is still a water tank for the country , " emphasizes Lima .
Within it is one of the supplies of the Guarani Aquifer , the underground reservoir that spreads below the Southeast and South of Brazil and through part of Paraguay , Argentina and Uruguay .
" But this reserve is leaking away without a vegetal cover that would secure the reposition of the water . "

Inverted flow
After successive occurrences of El Niño during the 90s , the Tapajós National Forest now liberates more carbon dioxide gas than it absorbs
Data collected from one of the twelve towers of the Large Scale Biosphere / Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon ( LBA ) that measures how much carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) -- the main gas responsible for the increase in the greenhouse effect , which is progressively raising the average temperature of the Earth -- comes in and goes out at different points of the ecosystem has shocked researchers .
According to the registers of this tower , situated some fifty-five meter high at a point at the Tapajós National Forest close to the small town of Santarém , in Pará , this stretch of the Amazon launches more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it absorbs .
This is the first time that an experimental tower , capable of registering ten times per second the concentrations emitted and assimilated of this compound , points to an overall loss of carbon in some parts of the forest .
In the long term , if this behavior persist , this would be equivalent to saying that this point of the forest ( and only this one , as far as we know ) has contributed to increasing the greenhouse effect -- and not to reducing it , as would appear to be the case with the Amazon in general .
The realization that this stretch of the National Tapajós Forest releases more carbon dioxide than it absorbs was carried out by the American Steven Wofsy , from Harvard University , one of the participants in the LBA , a mega international project of US $ 80 million that , since 1999 , has been bringing together more than three hundred researchers from Latin America , Europe and the United States under the leadership of Brazil .
The scientist , nonetheless , avoided making any more general comment about the role of the Amazon basin over the long term in the global balance of carbon dioxide .
" Throughout all of the forest we hope to see various standards , with some areas losing and some areas gaining in carbon , " said Wofsy during an interview for the February edition of the magazineEnvironmental Science & Technology .
" In the specific case of the Santarém tower , the annual deficit is around a half a ton of carbon per hectare , " says Paulo Artaxo , from the Physics Institute of the University of Sao Paulo , one of the LBA coordinators .
The sea and the forest
For Dr. Wofsy , the cause of the unprecedented negative balance in the flow of carbon dioxide measured at the tower in Santarém is related to the effects on the regional climate brought about during the last decade by successive El Niños , the abnormal warming of the superficial waters of the South Pacific that alters the indices of rainfall and temperature in several spots of the globe .
Because of the four El Niños registered during the 90s , there was less rainfall in the region of Tapajós and more trees succumbed to prolonged drought .
With the ending of the effects of this climatic abnormality , the levels of humidity in the Amazon , normally high , returned to their usual levels and accelerated the rotting of a large quantity of tree trunks and vegetables that had not resisted the dry spell .
The result : the rate of decomposition of abundant dead wood became so elevated that the levels of the carbon dioxide release overtook the intake rate by the photosynthesis of the forest .
In spite of the fact that the live part of the forest has responded positively to the re-establishment of the region 's high humidity , the growth of healthy trees -- read assimilation of CO2 -- was not as expressive to the point of overcoming the quantity of gas exhaled by the decaying of the leftovers of the vegetation .
The majority of scientists believe that the tropical rainforest is capable of absorbing more CO2 than it emits .
In practical terms , this vision implicitly confers upon Amazonia the role of removing a part of the excess of this gas present in the atmosphere and thus diminishing the increase of the greenhouse effect .
Recent data from almost all of the LBA towers are compatible with this theory .
Nevertheless , the quantity of carbon dioxide naturally assimilated by this ecosystem is , according to the most current measurements , equal to or only marginally greater than that expelled , with an annual positive balance of between 1 and 2 tons of carbon per hectare of the forest -- and not at 6 to 8 tons as previous studies has indicated .
Or that is to say , the cleansing effect of the Amazon on the atmosphere seems to exist , but may well be a lot more modest than had been thought .
Heat impact
This may well be true , but the unusual measurements in the Tapajós National Forest become even more interesting when compared with the results of another recent study , made within an environment similar to that of the Amazon .
In an article published in the May 13th edition of the scientific magazineProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , in the United States , researchers from the University of Missouri suggest that the trees of the tropical forest of La Selva , on the coast of Costa Rica , are growing less and are making their balance of carbon during the hottest periods to be negative , especially during years with a pronounced El Niño as during the period 87-88 .
After having analyzed the flow of carbon from 1984 to 2000 in La Selva , the authors of the study realized that , when the temperatures get higher than normal , the tree vegetation of the region begins to emit more CO2 than it is absorbing .
As can be seen , if the question is a loss of carbon during an El Niño year , the forests of Santarém and La Selva appear to exhibit similar behavior .
" In order to calculate the influence of the tropical ecosystem upon the greenhouse effect , measurements need to be taken in other locations and for periods of a much greater time span , " Artaxo comments .

The force of vacuum
Team from USP discovers the limits to the use of the Schrödinger wave equation , one of those most employed in the study of the atom
Carlos Fioravanti
Son of a physician , Aristotle learnt at an early age to show assurance in all that he said .
Later on , the Greek sage formulated the thesis that nature and a vacuum do not match .
Almost 3,000 years later , though , vacuum has ceased to be a synonym for emptiness and has become an inexhaustible reservoir of energy that can no longer be disregarded .
It is the vacuum that supplies energy to the electrons -- atomic particles with a negative electrical charge -- and keeps them in movement around the atomic nucleus .
Aristotle would be surprised if he knew that , without this energy , objects would not have formed .
There would be nothing besides a soup of electrons and protons -- particles with a positive charge -- that would not successfully organize themselves into atoms .
The physicistsfrom USP found that only Heisenberg 's formulation works in a satisfactory way , when the forces of vacuum are considered .
Accordingly , they established the limits for using one of the formulas most used in the study of the behavior of atoms , calledthe Schrödinger wave equation -- including vacuum , Schrödinger 's equation produces an incorrect value for the minimumenergy of the atom .
At the same time , the physicists from São Paulo did away with the ancient idea that the two approacheswould always be equivalent , and would lead to the same result about the minimum energy of the atom -- essential informationfor understanding , for example , at what temperature a metal melts .
Students , engineers and physicists are certainly going to like this news , because the equation that indicates correctly theenergy of the atom is Heisenberg 's , simpler and easier to work with than the other .
Schrödinger 's wave equation continuesto be useful , but dealing with it will call for a bit more attention from now on .
So as not to appear pretentious to the point of dethroning one of the founders of quantummechanics , she drew up a more modest version to explain what they had done : " We confirmed what Dirac had suspected . "
Solitary particles
Briton Paul Dirac rediscovered vacuum in 1927 .
20 years had already passed by since this kind of energy had beenproposed by Germany 's Max Planck , the discoverer of the strange world of quantum mechanics , in which atomic particlesacquire apparently absurd behaviors -- being able to be in two places at the same time , or going from one point to anotherwithout passing through the middle .
In 1963 , Dirac raised the possibility that the two routes for calculating the minimumenergy of the atom , Heisenberg 's and Schrödinger 's formulations , would not lead to the same result .
Dirac arrived at thisconclusion availing himself of sophisticated calculations , which described the interaction of the electron with theelectromagnetic forces of the vacuum .
His conclusions remained unknown until they were redeemed by the group from USPlast year .
The São Paulo physicists arrived at the same result as Dirac with a very simple conceptual model , equivalent to an electron immersed in a vacuum , vibrating on the tip of a spring .
It is the so-called simple harmonic oscillator with an electric charge , the same that can represent the hydrogen atom , with only one electron orbiting around a solitary particle -- a proton -- that constitutes the nucleus .
This model also represents the atoms of another six chemical elements -- lithium , sodium , potassium , rubidium , cesium and francium -- in whose outermost layer there is just one electron .
Based on this test platform , the researchers assessed , first , the equation created by Heisenberg .
Oddly enough , the mathematical route proposed by the German scientist to find the energy of the electron is similar to the approach adopted 300 years before by British physicist Isaac Newton to define the movement of any body .
Heisenberg and Newton , each in his own way , see acceleration as an effect of force acting on this body and therefore foresee movement , whether of a component of an atomic nucleus , or of a planet .
Newton , in 1687 , and Heisenberg , in 1925 , consider the position of the particle evolving in time -- a variable abolished in Schrödinger 's equation , formulated one year later , in 1926 .
The physicists from USP added theforces of vacuum to Heisenberg 's formula , and without any problem arrived at the correct value for the minimum energy ofthe electron oscillating on the tip of a spring .
Doing the same with Schrödinger 's formulation , they noted that the energy ofthe electron simply doubled and led to strange situations -- it would be like saying that an ordinary person almost 2 meters tallcan be up to 4 meters in height .
Schrödinger 's equation only worked without the forces of vacuum -- the maximum height ofthe people went back to be 2 meters .
That is where the practical recommendation comes from : do not add the forces ofvacuum to the Schrödinger wave equation .
Except in this situation , vacuum can no longer be disregarded .
The electron itself seems to perceive this kind of energydispersed in space , like a fly soaking itself with humidity before the rain starts to fall .
" The electron emits and absorbsradiation from the vacuum all the time , " França says .
" And it maintains the orbit stable because it emits the same amount ofenergy as it absorbs . "
Although almost imperceptible at room temperature , vacuum acts in a way that is similar to a magneticfield , resulting from the action of a common magnet , and manages to draw together two neutral metallic plates , in parallel andkept at a temperature close to absolute zero ( -273o Celsius ) , as has already been demonstrated experimentally -- it is theCasimir force , identified in 1954 .
Even if it is not known as well as electricity , vacuum is more intense than gravity , the most tenuous and all-embracing of the forces that govern the Universe .
The Casimir force becomes 16 times greater if the distance between the two plates falls byhalf , while gravity only multiplies fourfold .
It still remains to be proved , but one imagines that vacuum can be the mysterious dark energy , which corresponds to 73 % of the universe .
Straight away , besides explaining the composition of the cosmos , vacuum has become important for representing a usable form of energy , even to replace electricity .
This possibility arose only a few years after the quantum theory had become consistent , as a result of the joint work of a group of notable scientists that included Dirac , Schrödinger and Heisenberg .
In 1928 , when the phenomena that were to allow the construction of sound and television apparatuses were beginning to be clarified , American Harold Nyquist foresaw that vacuum could interfere with electric circuits .
On the basis of this idea , França , from USP , and a team from two American companies , Mission Research and ManyOne Networks , designed a piece of equipment that , if it works out , will successfully extract useful energy from a vacuum .
The apparatus consists of a coil with a diameter of 2 centimeters , cooled down to -270o Celsius , which ought to work like an antenna to capture energy from the vacuum .
" Depending on the way it is wound , the coil , in principle , can cancel out or increase the power for capturing energy from a vacuum , " says França .
The plan is to set up and test the experiment before the year is out , provided that the problems with the budget are overcome .
The prototype should not work out for less than R $ 150,000 .

Simplified disorder
Team from Campinas and the MIT draws up a method that facilitates the calculation of entropy
More than an obscure concept , disorder is a physical quantity that can be measured , in the same way as the length of a pencil .
The apparent confusion that accompanies the prosaic spreading of coffee in a cup of milk is called entropy , nowadays calculated on a computer using at least 20 different approaches .
As these techniques are complicated and laborious , a team from the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , in the United States , created a simpler method that leads to the same results : it is Reversible Scaling ( RS ) , which , according to its authors , goes so far as being 40 times quicker to calculate entropy and the free energy free for great temperature ranges .
Free energy is that portion of energy contained in a physical system that can be converted into useful work -- for example , only a part of the chemical energy contained in a liter of gasoline is transformed into movement in an automobile . " The
interest in calculating entropy and free energy is that they also signpost the way by which nature develops spontaneously , " says Alex Antonelli , from Unicamp 's Physics Institute , one of the authors of the program , jointly made with his former student Maurice de Koning , today at the MIT , and Sidney Yip , one of the pioneers in computer simulation in physical systems , also from the MIT .
In the case of water turning into ice , the free energy of the water is lower for the liquid state than for the solid state , at temperatures higher than 0 ° Celsius .
But the situation is inverted at temperatures below this level -- this is the reason why water freezes when cooled down to zero .
" The state of lowest free energy always predominates , " says the researcher .
There is also a delicate balance between internal energy and entropy -- in other words , free energy -- that determines the spatial structure of the proteins of any living being .
From cells to the heat of the Earth
The traditional method most used , Thermodynamic Integration , or TI , demands from five to ten simulations at a given temperature to get the entropy or the free energy at this given temperature .
Supported by FAPESP , the recently created RS starts off with a specific temperature , from which one finds out the free energy , andchanges it in a slow , dynamic way , with just one simulation -- that is where the time saving comes from .
" Nobody thought before of adopting this approach , because it was thought that it wouldn 't work , " says Antonelli .
Dreamt up by Koning , RS was made public in 1999 , in an article inPhysical Review Letters .
Adopted by such renowned researchers as chemist William Reinhardt , from University of Washington , it earned a detailed description in December 2001 , in theJournal of Chemical Physics .
In January , Nature Materials published a three-page article on this new approach , signed by Yip .
RS is not a computer program , but a public domain method .
For this reason , Antonelli reminds us , each researcher has to adapt it to his specific problems .
For example , a group from Rio Grande do Sul is interested in using this approach to calculate the free energy of the ions ( electrically charged atomic particles ) that pass through cell membranes .
RS may also be useful in studying the properties of materials , when simulation is the only way .
Recently , with an approach that , according to Antonelli , could be done in ten times less time using RS , and team in Britain estimated the temperature of the liquid iron in the center of the Earth at about 6,500 ° C .

Plugged into the world
An innovative study shows how dance and body evolved together and both in harmony with technology
Débora Crivellaro
A good way to understand contemporary dance is to understand that it wants to be plugged into the world .
In choreographers ' work , chance improvisation and common day-to-day movements are present .
The more their work are impregnated into the world , indeed contaminated by it , the better the result .
However , one cannot say that there is no rule , because at least one is followed to the letter : the search for diversity .
As one of the proposals of this movement is to move in the time of society , technology simply cannot be left off the stage .
From the end of the 80s , sensors , cameras and micro filming cameras , videos , holographs , software and specific hardware , laser and scanner , have all entered onto the scene as agents of the spectacle and have represented an esthetic reflex of this evolution .
The first registers of the use of a computer in dance date back to 1964 , but there is practically no studies on this theme here in Brazil .
This was the proposal of the choreographer and ballerina Ivani Santana , for her recent doctorate thesis defended at the Communication and Semiotic Department of the Catholic Pontifical University of Sao Paulo ( PUC-SP ) , which with FAPESP 's support resulted in the bookCorpo Aberto : Cunningham , Dança e Novas Tecnologias [ Open Body : Cunningham , Dance and New Technologies ] published by Educ .
The proposal was to understand dance and body as pertaining to the same evolutionary process in a chain link of semiotics .
Thus , it was noted that the new form of dance did not emerge as an isolated fact , grouped within only the artistic universe , nor was one dealing with inaugural estheticism , a form of art created by the extension of new artifacts .
Dance-technology came about starting from the change of the macro system .
The key to assimilating the work of these artists lies in the body itself , one of the instruments used to signal the changes in the universe , since within it indeed are contained many of these transformations .
In order to understand how dance-technology functions , one has to bear in mind that the digital era did not come on the scene as a mere scenic resource .
" One is not dealing with productions that juxtapose various media , this is not collage , " Ivani says .
For the author , the creations that make use of this technology only in a scenographic manner do not make up part of her reflections .
The technological resources are agents of the spectacle , as important as the ballerina , the music , and the programmer , and interact with each of them .
Art , science and technology become intertwined .
Software
The book traces a panorama on the use of technology in the digital era .
The first known research in the use of a computer as a scenographic assistant was carried out by Paul Le Vasseur , in 1964 , in France , and by Jeanne Beaman , in 1969 , in the United States .
From that time onwards , software has been developed for various functions , such as : choreographic notation and composition ( a type of choreographic score ) , research , analysis , creation and the capture of movements , educational assistance programs and computing environments for interference in real time .
The sensors can be placed on any part of the stage -- on the floor , on the walls , on the scenery , and / or on the bodies of the artists .
With all of this available , performances such as that presented inL 'Aprés-midi d 'un Faune , by Marie Chouinard , in Canada , took place .
Dressed with technological apparel , the ballerina Pamela Newell danced between five columns of light and had the opportunity to control them .
There also are more radical works .
In Australia , in the workSculpture of the Stomach , Stelarc literally discussed the question of the body in art .
A very small gadget , used in implants , is swallowed by the artist and captures the image of the interior of the body , showing a light that goes on and off in synchrony with the sound of a bell .
The celebrated ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov used the weight of the four hundred year old tradition of classical ballet to contribute with the spreading of dance-technology .
InHeartbeat : MB , by Christopher Janney and Sara Rudner , he commemorated fifty years on the stage leaving to the audible beating of his heart .
The Palindrome Group from Germany made use of the capture of images to control the environment .
Archived in the computer 's memory are inputs that transform themselves into new information , such as music , projection or illumination .
A camera is placed on top and two are available on the wings of the stage to register the height , breadth and depth of the image and to establish a three dimensional image ( this system is called the Frame-Grabbing System ) .
They turn themselves into a powerful sensor , since they perceive what is the trajectory realized by the movement of the body in space and time .
Another example of the sophistication to which these programs can reach is theVery Nervous System , by the Canadian artist David Rokeby , which detects , via a video camera , the presence , the immobility and the velocity of the performer 's action .
The captured images from one or two pieces of apparatus are mapped on a pre-defined grid .
Each small square , or any other allowed format , of this grid gives information about the changes that occur -- and the alert is done by way of the alterations of light on each region .
Thebest known program in this medium isLife Forms , used to assist in the creation of choreography .
By way of avatars it is possible to create and simulate movement in space and time .
In this scenario everything is possible .
" The setting of the work is controlled by emergent and experimental technologies , " Ivani says .
Team
With so many protagonists on stage , teamwork has become fundamental .
In this type of spectacle creation is divided up both by the choreographer and by the specialists in technology and the dancer , a co-creator in real time , who very often controls the various media on stage , during the presentation .
In order to put the work in harmony , each person must know a little about the work of the others .
The multimedia artist needs to understand dance and the performer also cannot be illiterate in new technologies .
" The creation of dance-technology does not need third party services from other areas , it is in need of true collaborative projects , since the arts work entangled with each other , " she adds .
Since 1996 , Ivani has been working with the musician Fernando Iazzetta , a researcher into the relationship music-new technologies .
The American choreographer Merce Cunningham makes up part of the book 's title because he is one of the people largely responsible for all of this opening up of dance , for the insertion of this art into the contemporary world .
An innovator since the 50s , and author of such phrases as " the dancers work with their bodies and each body is unique , " Cunningham , at eighty-three years of age , is active until today .
He created the process of chance , changed the form in which the body is to be worked , decreed that ballerinas could dance on whatever point of space .
And since 1989 has been working within the digital world .
When , in 1994 , she took an interest in dance-technology , Ivani did not even have a computer .
At that time , according to her recollections , she had already worked in Australia , in Japan , in the United States .
In Brazil , there was not a single bibliography available , nor study released .
This was one of the reasons for which the author got in touch with the Communications and Semiotics Department of the Catholic Pontifical University of Sao Paulo ( PUC-SP ) .
The practical result of Ivani 's work is the spectacle entitledGedanken , Dança Imagem Tecnologia [ Gedanken , Dance Image Technology ] .

Debret
A thesis reveals how Jean-Baptiste Debret wanted , through his work , to trace a biography of Brazil , a country that he had admired with illuminist impetus
Carlos Haag
Close your eyes and create , in your imagination , at the images of Rio during colonial times : I bet they will be like the works of Jean-Baptiste Debret ( 1768-1848 ) , with his blacks , fountains , tail-coated noblemen and ladies in litter who will come to your head .
" He , contrary to the others , truly loved Brazil and understood it deeply the fifteen years that he spent here .
On being shown the Brazilian customs , he wanted to associate them into a project for the correction of a territory that , according to him , merited being among the greatest of Europe , " states Valeria Alves Esteves Lima in her recently defended doctorate thesis at the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , The Picturesque and History Journey of Debret : a New Reading , which had FAPESP 's financial support .
In it the researcher reveals that the masterly work of Debret , of images and texts , was the fruit of a personal project by the artist , who intended much more than just to document the country , but to write the " Brazilian biography , " based on his illuminist beliefs ( inherited from contact with the painter Jacques-Louis David , who was his master ) and from a long personal experience of living in the Royal Court and the people of old Rio .
Thus , Debret the historian appears .
" Instead of taking in the images of what he saw as data that illustrated an experience during a journey , Debret elaborated a thinking about Brazil and authenticated its images on speaking to the public through his reflections , " Valeria observes .
" Thus , it is not simply a trajectory or a journey that he is describing , but an intellectual project about the march of civilization in Brazil , " the professor analyzes .
Or in the words of Debret himself : the progressive march of civilization , as the painter / writer wrote in volume 2 ofA Picturesque and History Journey to Brazil .
A son of Illuminism , for Debret the idea of progress was irreversible ; even if the reality before his eyes ( and even more clearly before ours , by way of his lithographs ) he didn 't show the country of the future , but of theold-fashioned world .
" For him , the idea of advancement could harbor periods of stagnation , but they would be overcome and regeneration , which is the process to which he refers and through which Brazil was passing through after the arrival of the Royal Family to Rio , " the researcher says .
" It was necessary to illustrate the habits and customs of old fashioned Brazil so that there would be no doubt about the advance of civilization , promoted through the House of Bragança in Brazil . "
Even more so because there was a gap between his arrival in the country in 1816 ( atforty-eight years of age , a mature and well prepared artist ) with the French mission , and his return to France in 1831 ( then sixty-three years of age ) and the almost eight years in which he carefully dedicated his work .
The professor alerts us to an almost generally forgotten aspect of Debret : the text that accompanies the images ofPicturesque Journey .
" He himself stated that ' what one unveils the other complements ' .
If the images had an autonomous life , his writing spoke bout a Brazil that had changed since the drafting of those images , of how there had been transformation and progress , " Valeria notes .
" Without the text , the image of Brazil that he so lovingly registered would be contrary to what he had intended . "
Fundamental detail : In Europe , Debret practically did not alter the watercolors that he painted in the country during his stay .
Once again , the historian appears alongside the artist .
However , a historian somewhat partial and far involved in the theme .
Worried about his Brazilian project , he made a selection of the material , selecting what interested him to prove his vision of the country 's future and to further spread his ideas , he transforms his water colors into lithographs , a means of spreading his ideas more cheaply and more widely .
The world needed to know the Brazil that he had loved .
Modern illuminist
But this national love had profound European roots .
Born in Paris in 1768 , Debret frequented the Jacques-Louis David studio , where he learned that , in illuminist modernity , the artistic ideal lay in the triad of art , politics and history .
" With David he learned that art needs to attend to the necessities of the moment and that the artist is , in this sense , responsible for the adjustment between art and history , " Valeria observes .
" Therefore Debret the historian appears at the moment of the elaboration of the texts and in the organization of the material for publication , " she evaluates .
" In this phase , which is that of making explicit his view of Brazil , Debret makes the effort to give to his registrations a historic update that they no longer had and that could jeopardize the desired content of his theme . " David
was also one of the pillars of art-testimony of neo-classical esthetics : the artist has to show , whenever possible , that which he had mirrored .
In order to show Marat dead in his bathroom , it is necessary to see him in a bath of blood .
History painted in its moment .
Brazilian reality
This helped to boost even further the career of an artist who had arrived in Brazil to teach the methodology that was dominant in European lands .
During 1826 , he transformed himself into the soul of the Fine Arts Academy .
" It was at that point , acquiring a growing knowledge about the problems and reforms of the country , that he gained a very clear vision about the reality of Brazil .
Debret talked with monarchs , ministers , politicians and , at the same time , received students from different parts of the country who told him details of their regions that he did not know , but that he could describe in his book , " Valeria explains .
" As well , he was able to count upon the assistance of European travelers , but , contrary to them , he had personal experience that went much further and did not restrict him to a mere description of day to day scenes , but he reflected about them . "
Once again the presence of David : what we see in his images is not a copy of reality but a verisimilitude that attests to the presence of the painter at that moment .
There is a subtle complexity in this portrayal almost faithful to the streets and the court , which seems to be moving before our eyes , even after centuries , but , at the same time , is the fruit of a conscious option of the painter , intrinsically linked to that of his projection of a vision of the nation 's future .
Diderot , another illuminist , had already called attention to the " libertinism of reason , " the thought that wants rational and precision sooner than the ideal .
" The link with reality is only one of the aspects of composition , whose result incorporates a long effort of reflection and a well traced out network of intentions , " Valeria says .
Slight disloyalty
From there onwards , there is the slight disloyalty to idealism in his images of the Brazilian Indians , which he hardly saw and whose painting did not fit into the " testimonial " role of David .
" He knew them from reports by others and from visits to museums where he could see artifacts and clothing .
And it was from this urban space that he would go on to take the facts and events that were important to his historic works of art , " she says .
" Thus , in his interpretation of the Brazilian population , he practically abandoned the idea of a savage and exotic population .
His evaluation of the Brazilian is not that of an individual marked by a constant and direct relationship with nature . "
Indeed , nature only appears as long as it is sensitive to the dominion of man 's action , modified and tamed by progress .
His images of the natives are the fruit of his projection : from the start , they appear in their exotic and primitive guise , but , all through the images ( and later on in time ) he prefers to paint modified Indians-- and , from his point of view " improved " -- through contact with civilization .
When he shows Indian dwellings and artifacts , it is only for the purpose that the reader will feel that this stage has already been overcome by progress .
" According to his reading , civilization was the overcoming of a natural phase that impeded the advance of the innate qualities of the Brazilian .
Hence the urgency to organize his historic past , arranged in volumes of his Journey , in such a manner as to make evident to the European that this inevitable path leads to progress in Brazil , " the researcher notes .
" The first volume of theJourney was dedicated to the indigenous population , in a non-civilized state , but at the same time , the point of origin of the civilized population : it is starting from the uncivilized that Debret 's illuminist thinking is going to interpret the advance of civilization in Brazil , " she adds .
In the end , there is nothing more adequate than to prove , by way of the power of time , the idealism of irreversible progress , even from the worst of starting conditions .
In the same manner , the scenery always disappears when it might jeopardize the reader who wants his images to be held by the European public .
" Nature , the space from which the idea of the Brazilian man was born among the majority of the travelers and interpreters of the country , was for him the dominion of civilized man .
Its richness and its savage and untamed character also served his necessities , whether it be as spaces for growth , or as models for the painting of scenery and history , " the researcher observes .
Even in the most exotic and picturesque forest , civilized man is stronger .
Masters and slaves
There is , therefore , in this idealism of progress something retrograded to our modern eyes , an inaudible feeling of respect for those blacks .
" In this country everything goes back to the black slave , " Debret writes .
More than ever before , the desire to faithfully reflect in theJourney " the character and the habits of the Brazilians in general " comes up and , in this manner , it would be impossible to look at the black in another perspective that is not that of his supreme importance in the majority of the customs and activities of the colony .
" There is in the iconographic representation of the blacks a physical and moral force that survives the denigrating comments of Debret .
The classical model that is used to picture them , raised them in the eyes of those who view his paintings , " the author observes .
For the French painter , concerned about Brazil 's future , the mixture of races had a fundamental function , through the union of the physical force of the blacks and the " superior intellect " of the whites .
Thanks as well to him we can perceive the intimacy between masters and slaves in the master home whose consequences were so well described by Gilberto Freyre .
Nevertheless , on the question of slavery , the well intentioned historian fell into a trap of contradictions between his discourse and beliefs and the terrible reality .
" Our imagery of this world gains a comfortable aspect from the water colors of Debret , " Valeria says .
Thus , even when painting a slave punished in a realistic manner , text and image harmonize together as part of the greater projection of the illuminist : the scene is heinous and shocking , but the text states that the penalty to which the slave is being submitted on the tree trunk had been within the limits of the law .
The liberalism of Debret raised to the extreme enters into shock with his vision of reality .
" He ends up creating , as a historian , a comfortable idealistic reality , wanting us to believe that we had been faced with a country in formation and that it had been preparing for the future , " the researcher concludes .

Back to life
Center takes the activity of legal medicine from the limbo to privilege teaching and research
Neldson Marcolin
The 30th of June of 1999 marked a change in the paradigm of Brazilian legal medicine .
On that date , in the town of Ribeirão Preto , Sao Paulo State , the Legal Medicine Center ( Cemel ) started to operate .
The main difference from other centers is the fact that it is installed in a university campus -- in this case that of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) -- , along with the Service for the Verification of Deaths in the Interior ( SVOI ) and the town 's Medical-Legal Examinations Center ( NPML ) was also transferred to the site .
The research carried out at the university is thus extended to the IML ( Legal Medical Institute ) , a rare fact in the history of Brazilian medicine .
The creator of the center , Carmen Cinira Santos Martin , a professor at the Pathology Department of the Medical School , had been fighting for almost eighteen years to take this specialty out of the limbo .
Her interest goes beyond having an improved building other than the decrepit and austere morgue of the town .
" I wanted to improve the teaching of the discipline of forensic medicine and to turn it into something as good as that what exists in the world , " Carmen explains .
The edition of the 1st of May ofNature had two pages describing the work being carried out at the Cemel .
The magazine took an interest in this distant center of a developing country when it got to know of the work of Marco Aurélio Guimarães , a young Brazilian researcher at Cemel who took his post-doctorate thesis at Sheffield University in Britain .
Guimarães extracted DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) from the bone and teeth of old bones , something difficult to manage even for the best laboratories in the world .
Carmen is collecting other fruits of her perseverance .
The Cemel Center is a reference for Brazilian towns and she is constantly invited to give talks at all ends of the country in order to explain how she attained this legal medicine working system .
The model of the center , a building of some 1,200 m2 , which today runs with thirty employees ( including those of the IML and the SVOI ) , also serves as an inspiration for the Public Health System ( SUS ) , which already has ready a minute on the law concerning questions on the verification of the cause of death .
In the following interview , Carmen explains the reason behind this success .
How did the magazineNature discover your work ?
-- The researcher Marco Aurélio Guimarães did his post-doctorate phase at Sheffield University in Britain , carrying out examinations on the DNA of bones from European archeological sites .
The results were excellent .
Afterwards he applied the same technique on material sent from Brazil .
The exchange of information between the reporter fromNature , David Adam , and the researcher , resulted in the interest of the magazine in knowing at first hand legal medicine at the Medical School of Ribeirão Preto , the material from Brazil that had been researched and the person responsible for it .
We are talking about Professor Daniel Muñoz from the Medicine School of USP in São Paulo , who was the first person to be interviewed by the English magazine and who spoke of his work regarding the identification of people who had disappeared during the military regime .
Was the story done here ?
-- Marco Aurélio returned in December to Ribeirão Preto and kept exchanging e-mails with the reporter fromNature .
He told him that he had been working at an emergent center of legal medicine , but that our country had immense difficulties in this area .
Then the reporter came here in February and stayed for two days with us , getting to know the location and asking about everything .
How did you come to work at Ribeirão Preto ?
-- I came here for my post-graduate thesis .
I studied medicine at the University of Brasilia , back at the beginning of the 70s .
I completed the course and did my residency in pathology .
Then , during the third year I wanted to quit medicine , as I didn 't like having to deal with sick people .
At that point one of my professors said : " OK , go and work with the dead . "
I thought it was an excellent idea and during my fourth year I was already starting to train in legal medicine .
Since then , I 've never left the area .
When I completed my residency , I wanted to teach , following a family trend .
And I wanted to give lessons on violence , a subject that fascinated me .
I chose Ribeirão Preto because it ran one of the best post-graduation courses in pathology in Brazil .
In fact , it was not the best , it was the second best .
However the first one , in Salvador , I couldn 't enter .
I went there , made my application , but since I was the only candidate during that year I wasn 't accepted .
You yourself wanted to have a teaching career in what exactly ?
-- In what I could do , which was pathology .
I was a pathologist , but had an interest in forensic medicine .
I chose pathology because it involves working with the body .
It was the only way of learning to deal well with the question , in order to later to apply that learning in questions of violence .
Since there was no master 's , doctorate , or medical residency in legal medicine , nor even a short specialization course in the universities , I opted for my post-graduation in pathology .
In truth , I could have applied for entry into the police force , which is where the coroners learn in Brazil , but I didn 't want to get myself involved in the Police Academy .
In Ribeirão Preto , all the professors interviewed me to see if they would accept me as a post-graduate .
I was clear : I stated that I had not enjoyed pathology , but liked legal medicine .
To which they asked : " What then are you doing here ? "
But one of them who ended up being my supervisor for my master 's and doctorate , Professor José Alberto Melo de Oliveira , looked through my résumé nd asked : " Wait a minute , you really like legal medicine ? "
I confirmed it and he helped me .
I ended up doing my master 's and doctorate on questions dealing with legal medicine within the Pathology Department .
Now , so many years afterwards , you intend to set up first forensic pathology course .
How is it going to be ?
-- In Brazil , medical residency in functioning legal medicine does not as yet exist .
We intend to make a bridge between pathology and legal medicine at the Medical School here in Ribeirão Preto , creating a four-year residency course in forensic pathology , which is part of legal medicine .
We 're in negotiations with the Pathology Department .
So , the master 's and doctorate courses in legal medicine are going to be on forensic pathology , which is none other than part of legal medicine , correct ?
I do not want to leave the Pathology Department which is excellent .
It 's simply a question of nomenclature , who wants to work , works independently from the name of the specialty .
Why has there always been difficulties in the teaching of legal medicine in Brazil ?
-- In the first place , the formation of a legal doctor does not exist .
Any medical doctor , with any background , can today take the course to be a legal doctor .
He takes the course by merely reading theory .
In the Police Academy -- I 'm speaking about the State of São Paulo -- , these candidates are trained during approximately one month .
They have to leave everything , family , other things to do , etc .
Many of them give up .
After this training , they begin their professional activity carrying out examinations in the morgue and looking at body wounds of people who are alive .
What they are learning to do is merely impressionist work ?
Only describing what they see , as any other person would do ?
-- That 's more or less it .
It 's not surprising that the quality of legal medicine in Brazil is extremely poor .
It 's only good on the occasion when the individual who is doing it is a very good professional through his / her own merit .
The Nina Rodrigues Institute in Salvador , where you yourself wanted to go , is it also the same ?
-- It is more or less the same , as it is throughout Brazil .
The difference is that in Salvador there is a more open environment .
Within the building of the Nina Rodrigues Institute I was even inspired to think about things here .
The institute there was better in days gone by .
When it 's together it works well .
When it 's separated the quality falls through lack of research .
You inspired yourself on what centers in order to create the Medical-Legal Center ( Cemel ) ?
-- Portugal has a model that I consider to be ideal .
But in Brazil , Salvador and Brasilia also have major importance because they are more open .
As a student , one could go to the Medical-Legal Institute and can walk through the building at will .
This was during the military regime .
These things only happened because the university opened up space .
Maria Teresa Pacheco , today a retired professor , allowed the student in Salvador to see legal medicine from the inside and not only in theory .
In Brasilia it was the same thing .
Why is the model for the Cemel different ?
-- Because we invited the IML to come to the university and we can work together , mainly in research .
Today we already have four legal medical doctors from Ribeirão Preto who have concluded or are concluding their post graduation and their research was motivated by the work carried out together .
This is a huge difference .
This was made possible by researchers at the Medical School of Ribeirão Preto .
Who had the courage to sign a check for R $ 600,000 for the creation of this center was Professor José Antunes Rodrigues , who is one of the best researchers that we have , and is an ex-director of the college .
How did this process come about ?
-- One day , back in 1996 , I spoke to Professor Antunes and told him that I had been at this school for nearly fifteen years and had never taken a student to the mortuary of the IML in Ribeirão .
And that I never would .
The IML had a terrible room ; small extremely ugly and poorly prepared .
Legal medicine already dealt with everything in a sad manner , everything ugly -- ugly for others , for me it is beautiful -- and I could not take a student who had been thinking in taking up another specialty to a place like this .
I wanted to bring students into legal medicine , seduce them with my specialty and not frighten them .
If one was to take them to the mortuary , they would never again wish to know about legal medicine .
I spent eighteen years giving lessons using models .
I even said to them : " If you want to go to the IML in Ribeirão , you can go , but I 'm not going to take you there . "
I said to Professor Antunes that I was not going to continue working in that manner , that I was going to do other things , and he ended up by taking over the Cemel project .
Why did Portugal serve as inspiration ?
The director cannot have a police career .
One doesn 't have the police in the middle , because the coroner is affiliated not to the Secretary of Public Security , but to the Secretary of Justice .
Dealing with magistracy is another level .
He is also a member of Amnesty International .
This model from Portugal is similar to that in the United Kingdom and the United States ?
-- I have copied the American model in one sense and the Portuguese model in another .
In terms of administration I copied the Portuguese .
In the United States , the university is not necessarily working hand in hand with the IML .
For example , I know very well the people from Colorado in the United States .
The head of the IML service is not a university professor , but has taken a course in pathology .
There lies the basis for all : he is a pathologist in the first place .
Afterwards he went on to do forensic pathology .
This is the good part of the American , British and Canadian models .
However , the administration of them is not as good as that in Portugal because the IML does not work in conjunction with the university .
Why is the system better when it is headed by a professor ?
-- Because of the university .
The professor values research .
But is it not a problem when the best university teams also turn themselves into bureaucratic teams ?
-- The professor of legal medicine does not carry out research in this area if he is not aware of what is going on within the IML .
This is the big issue that people do not understand .
In the IMLs there are competent professionals , but if they are not trained in research , they are going to work in a limited manner .
I am together with the IML but I don 't run the IML .
Although the administrative post should really be one of value , it is necessary that someone is available to create research groups in locations where there is teaching and assistance and scientific investigation doesn 't occur as it should .
Today I run two administrations .
I administer the Cemel because it belongs to USP .
The other administration , temporarily , is that of the Service for the Verification of Deaths in the Interior ( SVOI ) , which is a unit of USP .
Is it an advantage to have your IML colleagues here within ?
-- It is because it makes all of our work easier .
It is similar to the model in use by the Americans .
The American does the same thing only with a better base because the doctor that verifies death is the same person who examines violent death .
Does the formation of coroners in Portugal involve the same thing ?
-- No , in Portugal it isn 't so good .
In the other countries , the formation of the coroner is in forensic pathology .
In Portugal , I have found this large error , or that is to say , the coroner also carries out the verification of death without being a pathologist .
Why was the law of 9th of February of 1998 , published by ex-Governor Mário Covas , so important for your people ?
-- The previous law to this one stated that the coroner was subordinate to the police commissioner .
Who headed the coroner 's office was the police .
Governor Mário Covas put in the place of the police commissioner a criminal examiner or coroner .
This position , in the Covas law , is that of the Director of Technical Police .
In each administration , there will be a medical or a non-medical investigation .
What is the Public Policies Project , financed by FAPESP , like ?
-- This was the second Cemel Project .
The idea is to pass technology and training to the people at the IML of Ribeirão Preto and those at the SVOI .
When we began the work here daily , the lawyers contested the results on the blood alcohol levels because the methodology was inadequate .
It was at that point that I considered that Bruno Martinis , a very well trained researcher , already developing a project at the Cemel ( under FAPESP 's Young Investigator program ) , could take over the toxicology laboratory .
The Public Policies Project , which is entering into its second phase , has as its objective the training of technical people in the participating institutions to take samples for blood alcohol levels , which is the examination most in demand .
There are a few very basic procedures such as , for example , teaching that there are the appropriate receptacles for collecting blood .
Once certified that the training occurs adequately , the proponent institution , which is the Medical School , has the responsibility of transferring the sophisticated technology on the use of chromatography , the equipment that processes the blood sample .
The final hoped for result is the efficiency of the procedures and the certainty of trustworthy results .
Or that is to say , you had a problem of the lack of technology and training ?
-- The best piece of equipment in the hands of untrained technicians does not produce results .
When I said that the work is elementary , it is because we had to instruct on how to collect , guard and place in the fridge , etc .
Today the scenario has completely altered and things are much easier .
The project , financed by FAPESP , is important because it is not possible to imagine , in the times during which we are living , that we had still not gotten over these basic problems .
To have good equipment and well-trained technicians is a guarantee for the community .
What is the laboratory project on DNA that is going to function at the Cemel all about ?
-- The laboratory will be important when we don 't manage to carry out legal dental identification , or via a prosthesis , or by the absence of a limb .
In the region of Ribeirão Preto it 's very common to find bones during the collection of the sugarcane .
The sugarcane field is a place often used to hide bodies because the sugarcane , even when small , easily covers the body , which will then only be discovered when the plant is being harvested .
The laboratory will help when families reclaim the bodies and the common methods of identification are not enough to settle the question .
At that point , the DNA examination of the bones comes into play .
The project is ready , but laboratory equipment is missing .
And this Marco Aurélio Guimarães knows .
Furthermore , he has the legal-medical background .
This is important .
And how can your people help to identify the bones suspected of being those of who disappeared during the military regime and were found in the Dom Bosco Cemetery in São Paulo ?
-- There isn 't just one single method of identification .
Today one only hears of DNA , it seems that only this method exists .
But this is not so .
The easiest method , the best of them all is the legal dental identification .
If you have a worked on dental arch that has amalgams and resins that are registered , then it 's easy to identify the bone .
The same thing occurs with prosthesis .
I have had here a few dozen identifications done in this manner .
There is then no way to have any doubt .
It 's not possible for a medical surgeon to place a prosthesis in your leg and in mine and for them to be the same , so many are the variables .
We are going to help in this identification by way of the DNA exam when we 're asked .
Who finances the Cemel ?
Is it USP ?
-- USP pays a large part .
This building cost R $ 600,000 , paid for by the Medical School in order to have a discipline of legal medicine .
The money comes from USP , but comes out of the budget for the Medical School of Ribeirão Preto , we don 't ask for a special allocation from the university .
In order to pay expenses such as cleaning material , for example , there 's another source , also from USP , which is that of the SVOI , a university unit that 's housed here because it 's coupled to the Pathology Department .
This service has the salary payments for everyone who works here paid by USP and a part by the Secretary of Public Security .
At present the maintenance budget is very small that comes from the SVOI .
Per month there 's a total of R $ 4,489.00 to purchase cleaning material and to carry out all of the maintenance at the center .
When we need furniture , or a bricklayer , the school provides .
The IML has never given me any money .
But we arrange other solutions to manage things .
Therefore , so how am I going to purchase a top quality piece of equipment ?
I get a loan of that piece of equipment that belongs to the HC .
The maintenance material for the equipment is donated by the IML , who cannot give me the money but can donate the liquid , the x-ray plates , etc .
Summing up everything , I have help from the Hospital da Clínicas , employees loaned from the Municipal Secretary , from the State Secretary , material from the IML , and with this we mount and maintain the center .
Where does FAPESP come in ?
-- The excellent toxicology laboratory , under the responsibility of Bruno Martinis , was mounted thanks to the Young Investigator Program .
We didn 't get a cent from the university .
In the laboratory , there 's almost R $ 1 million worth of equipment financed totally by FAPESP , if we summed up all that Bruno gained with the project , as well as the Young Investigator grant .
Bruno and Marco Aurélio Guimarães also wrote their master 's and doctorate dissertations with grants from the Foundation .
Therefore , without this management it would be much more difficult for the Cemel to function ?
-- One always has to look for original solutions .
It may seem curious , but I don 't consider myself to be a researcher .
I think I 'm a strategist , let 's say that .
Of course , I publish papers abroad , guide students in their master 's and doctorate degrees , and suggest a good part of the research that is being done here .
But , above all I 'm an educator .
I breathed the same air as my mother -- and until her death , she was one of the best educators that I had known .
The bovine functional genome project will widen Brazil 's competitive advantage in the international beef market
During 2002 , Brazil counted some 183 million head of cattle and moved on to have the largest commercial herd in the world .
This year it is going to take over first place among the beef exporting countries .
With sales forecast at 1.2 million tons , passing ahead of Australia -- whose external sales should not be more than 0.95 million tons since they are suffering from a bad drought -- and the United States -- who have maintained the historic mark of between 1.05 and 1.1 million tons .
This competitive advantage gained by the country should widen with the research results from the Bovine Functional Genome Project , launched on the 7th of May of this year .
The project is going to identify the bovine genes of animals belonging to the Nelore breed , a variety of Zebu ( Bos indicus ) -- that make up 80 % of the Brazilian cattle herds -- in order to develop products and technologies that will permit overcoming limitations related to growth , quality of meat , health and reproductive efficiency , which still impedes greater competitiveness in the national cattle breeding .
" This is a historic leap for the country , " declared the São Paulo State Governor , Geraldo Alckmin , present at the launching of the project .
The studies will be undertaken by researchers with the Agronomy and Environment Genomes Program ( AEG ) , at twenty research laboratories .
The project has a budget of US $ 1 million , funded by FAPESP in partnership with the Central Bela Vista de Genética Bovina ( seePesquisa FAPESP magazine , edition No. 87 ) .
" The final objective is to improve the quality of the meat so as to achieve good prices and new markets , " says Jovelino Mineiro from Bela Vista .
" Biotechnology opens up a new window of opportunity for the country , " emphasizes José Fernando Perez , FAPESP 's scientific director .
Besides boosting the productivity of the herds and sustaining the outstanding position of Brazil in international beef commerce , the studies on bovine genome are going to allow the country to advance towards the demands of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , responsible for establishing the rules for sanitation , genetics and zootechniques .
These rules are based on research developed by countries with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge .
" With the functional genome project , we can anticipate and even establish new rules that guarantee even greater advantages on the world beef market , " forecasts the State Secretary for Science , Technology , Economic Development and Tourism , João Carlos de Souza Meirelles .
A cattle producer himself , the secretary is a qualified observer : he has been the President of the National Council of Cattlemen , of the National Committee for Animal Health , Vice President of the International Meat Secretariat and coordinator of the Forum for the Productivity Chain in the Bovine Cattle Raising for Mercosul , among other positions .
From registers to research
The functional genome study represents an extraordinary advance in bovine research that began last century when the first genealogical registers of the Brazilian herds were established .
" The first necessary piece of information to make any kind of genetic improvement is to know who are the animal 's father and mother , " comments Antônio do Nascimento Rosa , a researcher at the Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation ( Embrapa ) Beef Cattle , with its headquarters in the city of Campo Grande , in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul .
The first of these registers , dating back to 1904 , was started in the town of Bagé , in the State of Rio Grande do Sul , and catalogued bulls and cows of European origin ( Bos taurus ) .
During 1918 a register for the Zebu breed ( Bos indicu s ) was published by the Rural Society of the Minas Gerais Triangle ( a cattle raising region in the state of Minas Gerais ) , currently the Brazilian Association of Zebu Breeders ( ABCZ ) ; the original breed having come from India .
Starting in the 50s , there began to be carried out in Brazil the so-called Proofs on Weight Gain ( PGP in the Portuguese acronym ) .
" Animals from different herds were brought together in a confined environment or in a closed field and exposed to the same conditions so as to know which animals would gain weight the fastest , " tells Rosa .
At this point , the selection of the better animals would take place and they would be used for reproduction .
Classic genetics
In the 60s , the first great official leap forward in Brazilian production was registered with the establishing of the National Program for the Development of Cattle Breeding , when the country developed a cold store cycle and went on to invest in production technologies to improve the sanitary conditions of the slaughter houses .
Ten years afterwards there was the start of classical research into applied quantitative genetics , implemented by the universities , research institutions and associations of cattlemen in order to improve the herds .
These programs had as their objective the production of animals with improved commercial characteristics , or that is to say , animals that put on weight faster , had precocious reproduction and produced a better quality of meat .
" Today , after more than three decades of research , we can say that Brazil is a world center of reference in genetic improvement research , " declares Irineu Umberto Packer , from the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture ( Esalq ) of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) .
The Advanced Center of Technological Research in the Agribusiness of Beef Cattlebelongs to the Zootechnique Institute of the Secretariat of Agriculture of the State of Sao Paulo , one of the pioneers in research towards the reduction of the animal 's age for slaughtering , has registered scientific results and excellent practices .
" We can confirm a weight gain in the order of 1 % per year , or 3 kilograms , in the selected animals .
With this a young animal of one year of age , weighs close to 60 kilograms more than a similar animal twenty years ago , " explains Alexander George Razook , who headed the selection program of Zebu cattle ( Nelore , Guzera and Gir ) based on the post weaning weight and their effects on food conversion , reproduction and carcass , that started back in 1976 .
" This difference is translated in the weight at slaughter and in the carcass , " he stated .
Since 1991 , researchers at the São Paulo State University ( Unesp ) in the town of Botucatu , have also been carrying out research to accelerate the precocity of the animals .
" In Brazil , cattle take on average three to four years to be ready for slaughtering .
Started in 1999 , the project can count upon the participation of the Agrarian Sciences and Veterinary College ( FCAV ) of Unesp at Jaboticabal , the School of Medicine of USP at Ribeirão Preto , of Esalq and of the Biosciences Institute of Unesp at Botucatu .
" Now we want to produce a super precocious calf using only animals of the Nelore breed which , it is recognized , are considered late developers .
We have to discover how to accelerate the speed of the growth of bone and muscle tissue of the animal , and for this reason the Bovine Functional Genome Project is going to help us a lot , " says the researcher .
The Southeast Embrapa Cattle has also been working to raise the productivity of national cattle raising by way of cross breeding among different breeds , but maintaining the Nelore as the base , explains Maurício Mello de Alencar .
Five cross breeding systems involving bulls of the Nelore , Canchim , Angus and Simmental breeds along with cows of the Nelore or of high interbreeding of the Nelore , are being evaluated .
The research is part of the thematic projectCross Breeding Strategies , Management and Biotechnique Practices for the Sustained Intensification of the Production of Cattle Meat , also financed by FAPESP .
" It is a project for animal production that involves genetic improvement based on commercial cross-breeding , " explains Alencar .
" Our objective is to produce biologically different large calves in order to study their efficiency . "
After birth the animals are evaluated in various aspects ( genetic , nutrition , reproduction , health and economic ) throughout their lives .
The researcher explains that the calves and heifers are produced in different seasons of the year so that it will be possible to study distinct techniques of feeding and managing .
This is a lengthy project whose results should come out next year .
Pasture improvement
Besides the efforts to increase the productivity of the herds , there is also a search on for improving pasture .
" The average animal productivity in the country is of five arrobas ( one arroba is equivalent to 15 kilograms ) per hectare annually and 1,000 liters of milk per hectare per year .
These numbers can get as high as 58 arrobas and 45,000 liters of milk , respectively , depending on the degree of intensification of use of this pasture , " reveals Moacyr Corsi from Esalq , who has been investigating forms of improving Brazilian pasture for some thirty five years and is the coordinator of the thematic projectProperties and Evaluation of Irrigated Pastureland and its Management ( Capim ) , financed through FAPESP .
The quantity of pasturage depends on an increase of productivity of the fodder plant and of its management .
" In Brazil the average efficiency in the pasture is around 30 % to 50 % , which means that between 50 % and 70 % of the fodder produced is lost .
It is possible to raise the level of efficiency to between 70 % and 80 % , " Corsi forecasts .
The increase in production of pasturage might well be achieved through better soil conditions , by the use of liming and the application of fertilizers containing nitrates , potassium and micronutrients .
In twenty years , the birth rate measured by weaning -- generally occurring at nine months into the life of the calf -- has fallen from 72 % to 50 % ; the average age for slaughtering has been reduced from five years to three and a half ; and the production from the carcass -- measured by the quantity of meat and bone after the animal has been gutted and its skin removed -- has increased from 190 kilograms to 220 kilograms .
This gain in productivity last year allowed the country to produce 8.2 million tons of meat , to register an internal consumption of 37 kilograms of meat per capita , " one of the highest in the world , " according to Meirelles , and to export almost 1 million tons .
It has been this constant increase in productivity of the herds that during 1978 allowed Brazil to invert the inflection of the curve of importing and exporting .
Up until that point , the country had exported beef to Europe , mainly to Great Britain , but imported an even greater amount from the Argentine and Uruguay .
" During 1979 we became net exporters and we began thinking in a strategic manner about Brazilian cattle rearing , " the Secretary recalls .
Starting at the beginning of the 80s , the Productivity Chain of Beef Cattle , in the environment of the National Council of Beef Cattle was established .
The Council organized the productivity sectors -- " from the calf to the beef steak , passing through the leather industry , " says the Secretary -- , started up scientific research , the production of inputs , refrigerated slaughterhouses , the tanneries and the artifact sector and the leather industry .
" Today this conjunction of activities makes up the productivity chain with the largest number of direct jobs in the country : 8.5 million workers , " emphasizes Meirelles .
Currently the cattle industry represents two of every three hectares occupied by rural activities , or that is to say , of the 3.8 million square kilometers of the land where agricultural activities are being developed in the country , 2.6 million are dedicated to cattle rearing .
Epic zoo-sanitation improvement
However , to win over the external beef market , Brazil had to declare war on tuberculosis , on brucellosis and above all , the illness that terrorizes cattlemen : foot and mouth disease .
Various countries will not import fresh meat from regions with foot and mouth disease , among them the European Union , which is currently the main importer of Brazilian beef .
Scientific research and official vaccination campaigns against foot and mouth disease today guarantee that 140 million head of cattle , from a total number of 183 million , are raised in zones free of this illness , in a production band that runs from the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Bahia , passing through Tocantins , Mato Grosso and Rondonia .
The expectation is that the illness will be completely eradicated by the year 2005 .
Recent research is also promising advances in combating bovine brucellosis , which brings about abortion in cows starting at the fifth month of gestation .
The vaccine most widely used in Brazil is produced starting from live microorganisms but Sérgio Costa Oliveira , from the Biological Sciences Institute of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , has developed a DNA vaccine , already successfully applied in mice , which is currently under test with cattle .
" In genetic research we have evolved in a spectacular manner .
From the sanitary point of view the evolution of the Brazilian herds has perhaps been the greatest epic zoo-sanitation improvement in history , when one considers the size of the herds and the dimensions of national territory , " commemorates Meirelles .
" We have most definitely left the state of being mere shop assistants . "
Impunity and Violence
Researchers verify that the percentage of violent crimes converted into prison punishment of the accused is extremely low
Claudia Izique
The model of Justice that is supposed to protect Brazilians is weakened .
Over the past five years , of the 600,000 crimes registered in sixteen police precincts in the city of Sao Paulo , the indications are that only a small percentage could result in punishment with the imprisonment of the accused .
This is because , of a total of 338,600 crimes , violent and non-violent , analyzed during the period , only 21,800 were the object of a police investigation .
It is estimated , based on data from other studies , that of these investigations , 40 % come to be dropped .
If this statistic is confirmed then only 13,100 crimes become formal charges turned over to the Public Attorney for prosecution and listened to by the judicial authority .
" Some will be dismissed through lack of evidence , for example , and possibly something around 5 % of the crimes analyzed will result in a prison term , " says Sérgio Adorno , the coordinator of the Center for Studies of Violence ( USP ) , one of the ten Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers ( Cepids ) financed by FAPESP .
" In France for every 20 violent crimes , 19 tend to merit punishment , " he compares .
The numbers that are being revealed by the researchIdentification and Measurement of Indices of Penal Impunity are not that surprising .
Another survey , about murders of children and adolescents , carried out in Sao Paulo between 1991 and 1994 and already concluded , revealed rates of the conversion of crime into punishment at only 1.72 % .
Certainly , this picture is aggravated by the disorganization and lack of resources of the police to carry out investigations .
" The majority of the crimes are of unknown origin , " Adorno observes .
But also they can be related to the profile of the victim or of the aggressor , or to the nature of the crime suspect .
" And it could have to do with obstacles confronted by the defendants having access to penal Justice , including the very guarantee of the right of defense .
Paradoxically , it could even be related to subterfuge procedures , such as an excess of procrastinating resources that delay the application of penalties , " Adorno adds .
The result is that impunity helps to sustain crime and also feeds fear .
The research is on course .
It is part of an even broader project being developed by the center , in which the crisis in Brazilian Justice is being evaluated , including through historic studies of policies for public safety implemented in Sao Paulo since 1822 until today , through normative and official documents .
In the case of impunity , the researchers equally based themselves on official statistics , but also had to opt for other methodological procedures .
" In countries with reliable statistics , the flow of the criminal justice system produces statistics through all segments -- police , judicial and in the execution of the sentences -- , which allows one to observe the movement of registered crimes , charges and lawsuits and convictions , " he explains .
In Brazil , however , continues Adorno , the available statistics , besides being incomplete , do not allow a follow up .
As a function of the extension and volume of the information , it was necessary to restrict the survey to a single section of the police who coordinates the performance and the activities of the police precincts in the West , Northeast , and South zones of the city , in a total of fourteen police precincts and two specialized police precincts .
Instead of accompanying the general movement of crimes , they turned to the individualized observation of the logs as a way of pursuing their destiny in the interior of the criminal justice system .
" We made a detailed and critical study of the primary police registers , in such a way as to close in on the crimes that effectively interested the observation , or that is to say , homicide , robbery , robbery followed by death , rape , drug trafficking , considered to be violent crimes , " he explains .
The first part of the research is practically concluded .
In the second phase , there will be a detailed study of the police inquiries and penal processes .
Risk situation
Since 1987 , the Center for Studies of Violence ( USP ) has been analyzing violence and human rights violations in the country and developing studies on themes such as public safety policies and the participation of the community in the solution of violence .
Currently , it is developing five lines of research among them the projectThe Identification and Measurement of the Rates of Penal Impunity , coordinated by Adorno .
Just like the study on impunity , the major difficulty for the researchers of the other projects , lies in the collection of data .
It is known that in São Paulo the homicide rate corresponds to 186.7 deaths for every 100,000 adolescents between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years , and 262.2 deaths for every 100,000 citizens older than twenty-four years , according to statistics for the periods 1995 and 1998 , respectively .
But little is known about the perpetrators and very little about the victim , beyond their place of residence and death cause .
The registers of the justice department , the police or of the health system don 't throw light about the nature of this violence , don 't inform about the group responsible for the homicide , nor even give any hint whether there was a relationship between those involved .
Between 1996 and 2000 , for example , while the average rate of homicide for the capital grew from 55.6 per 100,000 inhabitants to 66.9 , the district of Jardim Angela had already registered the mark of 116.23 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants .
This disparity was observed in various districts of the city .
The numbers and the geographic distribution of the occurrences suggest that the regions with high rates of homicide were equally those with the highest concentration of poverty .
Based on this data , the researchers from the Center initiated geo-referencing research on the violence .
They verified that it was not the high concentration of the poor population that was responsible for the high murder rates .
The scenario of violence registered high concentrations of adolescents between eleven and fourteen years and between fifteen and nineteen years , a large number of heads of families with less than four years of schooling and / or without income , low level of local employment opportunities , infantile mortality rate higher than average , absence of hospitals in the region , less access to sewage and with highly congested home conditions , that is less privacy , greater tension and competition for space .
Employment is scarce in the areas of high rates of homicide and the alternative for the heads of families is in the informal labor market , with irregular employment , poor remuneration , and subject to periods of prolonged unemployment .
Forced inactivity can increase the tension within the family , alcohol abuse and tends to favor violence .
In fact , in the twenty-four city districts where there are many heads of family without income , studies show that violence increases .
" The institutional links between the population and the authorities are characterized by tension , mutual suspicion and even almost non-existence , " says Nancy .
For example , this absence of links shows itself in situations such as a lynching .
" A lynching appears as something that happens on the spur of the moment , but , when the case is investigated , it is possible to state that the population had previously mobilized itself in similar situations , without having obtained the support or protection of the authorities .
" The age bracket between eleven and fourteen years is very exposed to the situation of the most severe type of violence : parents , as well as school , already consider that he or she can live on their own and they end up without any type of supervision , " Nancy states .
In the moments when they are becoming adults , these young people end up adopting risky behavior , frequently involving themselves in situations of delinquency , alcoholism , drug use , among others .
Or they become easy targets in conflicts for fruitless motives such , for example , fights with neighbors because of a broken window , loud music etc .
" The problem resides in identifying what social situations are more associated with risk , in such a way that the governments and civil society associations can promote prevention programs , " advises Nancy .
Defenseless victims
On identifying the most defenseless victims , researchers from the Cepid began to work in a school in the Jardim Angela district with children between the ages of eleven and fourteen years , in an attempt to develop models for managing conflict .
These meetings were named by the living together forum as " who wants to come , comes , " Nancy says .
" We discussed the quality of life , violence , criminality , conflict between men and women , relations with friends during the school break , among other situations , and the advantage of doing things together , " she says .
The intention of the researchers is to initiate these young people in the resolution of small conflicts , following a model developed by the Canadian researcher Clifford Shearing to deal with violence in housing estates in Toronto , Canada , and which was adapted to mediate tension in the ghettos of South Africa and in needy communities in the town of Rosario in Argentina .
" When the community begins to settle internal conflicts , it gains much more power to negotiate with the authorities on its situation , " Nancy explains .
Before starting the groups , a work proposal was presented to the teachers , the parents and to the students themselves , who visited the headquarters of the Center for Studies of Violence ( USP ) , installed at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) .
Besides these teenagers , the researchers also worked through living together forums with adults and the graffitists of the region .
" The people didn 't see themselves as a community , partly because of the day to day violence and of their economic needs , " Nancy explained .
The graffiti writers , in fact , helped in the consolidation of the groups of adolescents that were rejected by the other students in the school .
" The graffiti writers are respected and this gives them prestige , " the researcher explained .
The expectation is that , if they learn to deal with incidents of personal violence , they will be stronger to negotiate with the authorities.The
Center has also implanted violence observatories in four communities , in order to debate the problem from the perspective of the victims .
And is also developing five educational projects having violence as their central theme , directed towards pedagogical guidance counselors within the municipal and state teaching networks , among others , as well as a distance learning project in partnership with the Future School .
" Now we are training a team from Mozambique , in collaboration with the World Health Organization , in an inter-ministerial project that brings together programs on epidemiological vigilance , prevention and evaluation of violence . "

Risky algorithm
Project in public policy measures situations of violence of the São Paulo population
The vast majority of acts of violence that result in injuries caused by firearms in the city of São Paulo occur at the weekends , mainly on Saturdays .
Sexual aggressions towards women are more frequent during the weekdays , with their peak being on Thursdays , when they are a long way from the family , going to work , to school or shopping .
The average age of the victims is thirty years .
" With a little investment it is possible to develop and implement a system of monitoring capable of capturing the information regarding violent incidents and the most common accidents , " says Paulo Saldiva , a professor at the Medical School of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and the coordinator of the projectEpidemiology of the Violent Criminal in the City of Sao Paulo : A Study on the Macro and Micro Scales , developed in partnership with the Municipal Secretary of Health , the Secretary of Prison Administration and the Mathematics and Statistics Institute of USP , under the umbrella of the Public Policies Program funded by FAPESP .
Saldiva , a specialist in the study of the effects of atmospheric pollution on human health , decided to make use of the criteria of epidemiological research to study violence , using statistics for risk assessment .
" Violence , different from pollution , is not homogeneously distributed .
It is necessary to take into account variables of time and space and to create new theoretical techniques to assess risk , " he recognizes .
The studies , the same as had happened with the researchers from the Center for Studies of Violence ( USP ) ( see material on page20 ) , got bogged down in the difficulties of collecting reliable data in the official organs of public security .
The option chosen was to collect information about the theme within the health system .
In the case of the data from the Saboya Hospital , " in spite of the efforts and dedication of the Center for Attention to Violence Victims , " he emphasizes , the analysis of the data was made difficult by the lack of standardization of some important variables .
For example , the researchers had to generate some variables such as the classification ofthe occurrence , taking as a base the information registered in the reason for registration of the complaint and the description of the occurrence .
" The quality of the information is an essential item in whatever research study , " he observes .
In order to define the classification of the occurrence , the researchers fell back on the International Classification of Diseases , frequency of determined occurrences and specific interests of others , in order to reach the following main categories : accidents , aggressions , legal interventions , medical and surgical complications and events of ignored intention .
The aggressions were classified into self-aggression , sexual aggression , other types of aggression using a firearm , with the use of other bruising instruments , and other aggressions with the use of physical force or non-specified.Standardized and classified , the registers revealed precious information .
For example , they indicate that men and women show similar distributions in relation to the age of the victim at the moment of registering the occurrence , a tendency for a drop of violence in the months of January to July , followed by a continuous increase from August to December , and the prevalence of victims of the female sex during this period .
In the distribution of the occurrences by age groups and location of the fact , the researchers observed a greater frequency between sixteen and sixty five -ears ( 9.2 % ) in violence registered in the work location and a greater incidence of victims in the one to five years age bracket when the aggression occurred in the home itself .
In the other occurrence locations -- commerce and services areas , public streets and roads , in someone else 's home , not informed and others -- , the distribution of the cases was similar in all of the age groups .
Promiscuity and violence
Saldiva 's team also collected data about violence from the Coordination of Prison Health System ( Cosaspe in the Portuguese acronym ) , which brings together all of the records related to hospital attention given to inmates in the city of São Paulo .
" Cosaspe did not have any computerized information .
Thus the first stage of the work was to develop , in partnership with the Secretary of Prison Administration , the structure of a data bank to make a beginning in digital records and then make an analysis of them , " says Liliam Pereira de Lima , the statistician who participated in the project .
Here also the data was revealing .
Violence in the prisons shows itself in the form of illnesses : HIV and tuberculosis , with occurrence of 67.5 % and 35.1 % respectively in the patients detained in the Hospital Center of the Carandiru Prison , where a large part of the cases of illness and violence occur in the São Paulo penitentiary system .
Gun wounds did not surpass 5.2 % , and those with a side arm , 1.3 % .
In both cases , the victims were sent to the hospital by the Secretary of Public Security , responsible for attending to the wounded in the police precincts .
These aggressions , nevertheless , could have occurred as the moment of arrest .
Violence , in the case of the penitentiary system fails to control contagious infectious diseases .
" The prisons are unhealthy and the prisoners live in promiscuity , " emphasizes Saldiva .
" The solution is in the reduction of the possibility of contagion and in the distribution dispensing medicines to control these diseases , " he adds .
Risk Algorithms
Having concluded the diagnosis , the research project is now entering into the second phase .
" We are going to propose to the penitentiary system a codification for the data and the management of the information based on logical criteria , " Saldiva says .
In the area of health , the proposal will be to implement a unified system for the completion of critical information that will feed a data bank on violence in the city .
" Qualified information , for example , will allow us to discover the cost of violence related to medical procedures , the number of lost working hours , among other information relevant to implementation of public policies , " Saldiva says .
This data will allow the elaboration of a geo-referenced map in the study of morbidity .
However , Saldiva wants to go further with his project and reach an algorithm on risk calculation that could be translated into an alert to society : a woman , walking alone , in the region of such and such a street during the period of X hours until Y hours , has a high percentage of risk to becoming a victim of sexual violence .

Unicamp invests in innovation
Inovacamp is going to evaluate the demands of the private sector in order to direct research
On the 15th of May , the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) launched the Innovation Agency of Unicamp ( Inovacamp ) , coordinated by Carlos Américo Pacheco , a professor at the Economics Institute and ex-executive secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology ( MCT ) .
The first step is carrying of a study to define how this park will be and what type of the industrial segment it pretends to attract .
" The information technology companies will most certainly be present because Campinas already has various companies in this area , but we could also bring in the newly born sector of biotechnology , " Pacheco says .
Unicamp received R $ 2.8 million from the Financier of Studies and Projects ( Finep ) to carry out the study that will be completed in one year .
An important role for Inovacamp will be improving the relationships with strategic partners , such as Petrobras and Embraer , who have already developed various research projects with Unicamp without a central coordination to lay out a long term work plan .
" Today , for example , we can have two or three pieces of research happening in parallel within two or three Petrobras departments without there being any integration between them , " Pacheco explains .
In order to attend to strategic partnerships , Inovacamp will have a specialized technical body that will do the mediation between the company and the researchers , centralizing all of the information about the ongoing research projects .
Thus , the intention is to understand the strategy of the company 's performance and make it fully realize what Unicamp has to offer .
According to Pacheco , the important thing is that with this information the group of technicians can define what will have to be done in the long term .
The Agency will strive to facilitate the access of researchers to sources of funding .
Product registration
One of the ways to identify the type of research that better attends to the needs of the private sector is the carrying out analysis of some areas , identifying directions , tendencies and challenges .
The idea is not necessarily to increase the number of partnerships , which is already large , but mainly to anticipate theneeds .
Unicamp was responsible for eighty-eight of the two hundred and thirty four patents registered by public research institutions between 1997 and 2000 .
The challenge now is to turn these registered patents into products .
" Today a patent is merely a cost .
We want to transform it into a technology license , " he explains .
For Pacheco , this is a favorable moment for initiatives that will attempt to facilitate the relationship of universities with the public and private sectors as there is a national conscience about the importance of technological innovation for the development of Brazil .

Cautious optimism
For , it is time for Brazil to transform its power of research into economic advantage
If six months in command of the country have not been enough time for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to promote deep changes in the national scientific policy , the first steps in the new federal government in the area of science and technology , though still far from having pleased everyone , have managed to inspire a courageous editorial and articles in the issue of the 22nd of May of the British magazineNature , one of the most respected scientific publications .
In the editorial , the publication states that President Lula da Silva , originating from a left-wing party ( PT -- the acronym in Portuguese for Workers ' Party ) , has been impressive in dealing with the Brazilian economy , the target of a large part of the initial attention of the new administration .
It assures that , in spite of its social and educational problems , the country can count on lots of " young talent " willing to carry out science and graduates more than 6,000 doctors per year .
" Brazilian science has already proven that it can compete in the international arena with the publication during 2000 of the complete sequencing of the genome of the pathogen of citrus bacteriumXylella fastidiosa , " wrote David Adams , when referring to the project financed by FAPESP .
The Amazon Vigilance System ( Sivam ) was also described as the " most ambitious of its type in the world . "
After having interviewed and written about some of the Brazilian scientists in their journalistic articles , the magazine prints that " there is a widespread mood of cautious optimism " about the actions of the new federal government in the area of science and technology .
And then exemplifies : during 2003 , in a difficult year for the Brazilian economy , the federal budget for S & T appears , up until now , to have escaped cuts ; the Lula government has promised to double the annual budget for research and development by the end of its administration ; and they have recruited good personnel into the ministry and the federal research development agencies .
From what one can gather from Adam 's article , the adjective cautious comes from the reactions , not very positively expressed , at the start of the year by the national scientific community on the announcement of the name of Roberto Amaral for the post of Minister of Science .
" The objectives can be praised , but moderation is really needed : President Lula da Silva will limit the potential of his country if he disseminates initiatives in a very wide manner throughout the national territory . "
Greater weight
For the magazine , the situation in the state of São Paulo , by far the heavyweight in the production of Brazilian science , cannot be reproduced at the national level not even in the medium term taking into consideration that , in the words of the publication , some states have only rudimentary scientific base .
" So São Paulo stands out not only because of its commitment with the public university and the funding of science , but also for its strategic approach towards science and technology .
This includes creating conditions that favor the launching of high technology companies , attracting industrial investment from abroad and giving support to research centers that are going to bring in not only science of high quality but also stimulate new commercial companies , " says the editorial inNature .
According to FAPESP 's scientific director , José Fernando Perez , the British magazine recognizes the efforts made by Brazil and by the state of São Paulo towards the development of science and technology and is pointing to the need to democratize the national research system .
" Nevertheless , the expansion of the system cannot be done through sacrificing the centers of excellence , " Perez emphasized .
Researchers look for support to found a Neuroscience Institute in Natal
Brazil has to lose its inhibitions and inferiority complex and turn itself into a production agent of science of top quality , capable of yearning to win a Nobel Prize .
This is a dream that is driving the neuroscientist Miguel Nicolelis , a forty-two year old Paulista ( Born in São Paulo ) who has been doing research in the United States for the last fifteen years .
Together with two other Brazilian neuroscientist -- Sidarta Ribeiro , thirty two years of age , and Cláudio Mello , thirty nine years of age -- , he is cuddling an ambitious project : to transform the city of Natal , in the state of Rio Grande do Norte , into the capital of national neuroscience , beginning with the founding of an international institute capable of attracting researchers from the country and abroad .
" There is a very high exodus of scientists and we believe that the political moment , with the election of President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva , is favorable , " Nicolelis , professor of neurobiology and biomedical engineer at Duke University in North Carolina , points out .
The project even forecasts the construction of a free teaching center capable of giving training of the highest caliber to between 300 to 500 children .
" The idea is to place emphasis on the sciences , languages and creativity , " Nicolelis says .
The two initiatives -- above all that of the founding of the school -- can already count upon the support of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ( UFRN ) .
" These children are going to work and study with people who are at the top in science , which in themedium- term will give an incalculable return to society , " celebrates the pro-rector of post graduate research at the UFRN , Nilson Sena de Almeida .
" There will be attention paid to the highly talented children as well as those with learning difficulties .
It 's a brilliant idea , a new model , " says the pro-rector enthusiastically .
Collective work
Ways to make the project viable -- whose installations should be ready in three years and fully functioning in at the maximum five , according to Nicolelis 's project -- are being studied .
The possibility that it can contribute to the decentralization of scientific production may attract resources from the Ministry of Science and Technology ( MCT ) .
" And democratizing is a way to attract the foreign scientist , " adds Nicolelis .
As a matter of fact , the MCT has already made its first moves .
" The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) is going to participate with grants and the Ministry will open up a competition for getting the researchers in place .
This is collective work , " says the Secretary of Policies and Programs in Science and Technology at the Ministry , Gilberto Sá .
But the idea is not to just rely on the support of the government , but also on business and international foundations .
" The Max Planck Institute in Germany has already signaled its intention of placing resources in the project , " forwards Almeida .
Nicolelis said to that Hannah Hoag , of the magazineNature ( see story on page 27 ) , says that the group will need some US $ 20 million to build and equip the institute .
He also said well that the team plans to manage these resources by way of a non-profit organization that , when established , will be called Alberto Santos-Dumont .
Up until now , the project can count upon US $ 50,000 obtained by private donations .
These resources will be eaten up in the funding of an international conference on neuroscience , sponsored by Duke University in partnership with the UFRN , which will take place in Natal , in March of 2004 .
Among others , the event has the confirmed presence of Torsten Wiesel , the President Emeritus of the Rockefeller University in New York , a laureate and winner of the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1981 .
Nicolis guaranteed toNature that Wiesel agreed to be a member of the Institute 's Board , as well as the neuroscientist Jon Kaas from the Vanderbilt University in Nashville .
" The Secretary for Tourism of Rio Grande do Norte , Haroldo Azevedo , guarantees that the state government will give all its support to the project and is negotiating the donation of land close to Barreira do Inferno , which belongs to the Brazilian Air Force .
" The location would be ideal because it 's close to the UFRN campus , it 's of easy access , is sited in a preservation area and is close to the beach . "
Nicolelis and his group of friends made their plans and ideas public on the 6th of May in an article published in the newspaperFolha de S.Paulo .
Isaac Roitman , the evaluations director at the Coordination of Training of Personnel of Higher Level ( Capes ) has already joined the cause .
" These are young people who chose Natal for a number of reasons among which is that they believe that there must be a more homogenous regional distribution of science . "
Roitman emphasizes that the UFRN is a fine option because it can count upon an important center of primatology and is an area strong in psychopharmacology .
Claudio Mello , another of Nicolelis 's partners , has been working in the United States for fifteen years where he is a researcher at the Neurology Institute of the Oregon Health and Science University .
A Ph.D. in neurology and a specialist in learning and memory , Mello considers the proposal of a center of excellence unbound to an academic structure , along way from the Rio-São Paulo and where research of high quality can be carried our , to be seductive .
The third partner is the neuroscientist Sidarta Ribeiro , who has lived for eight years in the United States and is working beside Nicolelis at Duke University , studying the formation of memory during sleep .
Of recognized talent outside of Brazil , Ribeiro would not hesitate in leaving it all behind .
" Brazil is passing through a very positive change and now is the hour to return and contribute . "
The army of Brancaleone
Director Roitman says that Capes is assisting the research group in negotiations with the UFRN , development agencies , the CNPq and Finep .
The first contact with the university 's administrative board , local researchers and the State Governor , Wilma de Faria , demonstrated the fine receptivity of the project .
" We are in need of , for the academic community throughout the country , a culture of donating .
And at this point enters the line of convincing the Brazilian aristocracy and of the proposal of establishing a law that could guarantee some tax breaks in as incentive to projects . "
The Governor has still not confirmed the possible donation of the land , but says that she has spoken about it with the Minister of Science and Technology , Roberto Amaral , to demonstrate the intention of the State to receive the neurosciences center .
" I have requested all institutions of Rio Grande do Norte to push forward so that this wish becomes a reality . "
The Governor guarantees that her government will participate in the investment for the installations and in the concession of research grants .
" The founding of the institute will be a revolution for the state , " she evaluates .
" Beating once again "
In the end , we opted for a solution away from music , but one of these beautiful phrases insistently remained with us in the days that followed .
They are the opening lines of a touching samba song , As Rosas Não Falam ( Roses Don 't Speak ) It says : " Beating once again with hope within my heart ... " It matters little that from the song comes some shreds of the pangs of love without hope of becoming a real relationship , because what remains from the emotional atmosphere of the song are its positive palpitations .
I believe that it was the word hope , or its combination with the heart , which weighed more for this good and prolonged intrusion of the samba in the difficulties involved with the finishing of this issue .
Because , if above all , it is scientific competency that the story shows when it demonstrates the experiments by the groups from Rio de Janeiro , Sao Paulo and Bahia using stem cells for the recovery of the cardiac muscle affected by cardiac insufficiency coming from different cardiac illnesses -- with promising results -- , it is also about hope that the text speaks .
The hope , for example , of prolonging life , with quality , for patients who up until this point had in a heart transplant the only alternative for survival .
As yet in the experimental phase , the little invasive transplant of stem cells , related by Ricardo Zorzetto , assistant science editor ( page 34 ) , is a beautiful promise against chronic cardiac insufficiency brought on by hypertension , obstruction of the coronary artery and Chagas 's disease .
It is in the vast and not always fully understood field of genomic research that the Brazilian researchers are waging this fine war in favor of the heart .
And when speaking about genomic research , the report about the conclusion of the genome project of the bacteriumLeptospirosis interrogans ( page 42 ) by São Paulo researchers with collaboration from their colleagues in the state of Bahia , also merits highlighting .
In this text our special reporter Marcos Pivetta , after recalling that a team from the Chinese Human Genome Center had concluded a little beforehand the sequencing of another variety of the bacterium , the Lai , relates that the Brazilian group , as well as unmasking the molecular structure of the variety Copenhageni , that responsible for the majority of cases of human leptospirosis in Brazil , have requested in the United States , the patents for twenty four genes and their respective proteins , which could be useful for the development of both a vaccine and more efficient diagnostic tests .
In Technology , we highlight the report by the editor Marcos de Oliveira ( page 62 ) about the Genius Institute of Technology in the city of Manaus , which is pursuing innovations in the areas of electronic equipment , telecommunications and multimedia .
Founded by Gradiente , bringing together ninety researchers from fourteen Brazilian States , in a short period of time the institute has accumulated conquests and is preparing itself to widen its base , beginning with a branch in Campinas .
And finally , a demonstration of Brazilian contradictions on the pages of the magazine , illuminated by the activity of research : on the one side , starting on page 20 , the editor Claudia Izique relates the results of the work of the Studies Center on Violence among which : of the more than 600,000 violent crimes registered in sixteen police precincts in the city of São Paulo over the last five years , only something around 5 % have resulted in punishment .
On the exact opposite , on page 27 , we have the editorial news and reporting of the edition of the 22nd of May of the magazineNature in which , among words of explicit recognition of the dynamism exhibited by sectors of Brazilian science , the magazine suggests to President Lula da Silva that he grasps the opportunity of transforming the force of Brazilian research in the physical and biological sciences into economic advantage .

Genius Innovations
Private technology institute generates products , seeks independence , and starts to set up a branch in Campinas
Marcos de Oliveira , from Manaus
In a short time , it has accumulated a series of conquests , with the creation of a new type of karaoke that uses an unprecedented way of assessing the performance of the user , a set of solutions for voice recognition in Portuguese , as well as various software and electronic circuits for mobile telephony and DVD and digital TV equipment .
They are results achieved in an experience that is unique in Brazil .
In a couple of years , the institute has been capable of attracting 90 researchers from 14 Brazilian states and from seven countries .
There are 13 doctors , 65 with a master 's degree awarded or studying for one , and 12 graduates .
A gathering of competencies that wants to be in the front line of technological development in the areas that the institute has embraced .
Now , with its model for work consolidated , Genius wants to become increasingly independent of Gradiente , the company that created it , and is expanding its bases .
Today , Gradiente no longer makes cell phones and has no more rights to the corresponding incentives of the Information Technology Law , so that it is treated like any other company by Genius .
The institute is modifying a remaining link with the founder , which has a majority interest in the company 's capital and on its board .
" The present one is made up of five Gradiente employees .
We are in a process of change , so that there will just be a minority interest , " Vianna explains .
" Our annual income is made up of funds for projects approved by the Telecommunications Technological Development Fund ( Funttel ) and by the Information Technology Sectorial Fund ( CT-Info ) and , in particular , by contracts with companies for licensing or for developing new products or solutions . "
The biggest customer still is Gradiente , which at the beginning of next year should launch the first DVD player with totally Brazilian technology .
Up until now , the company , like the others , imports kits and assembles the devices in Manaus .
Now , it is going to stop buying these kits and start negotiating the components , like chips and other supplies , with the international suppliers .
" To arrive at this point , researchers from Genius have developed the software for the devices ; part of the technology was absorbed from South Korea , where the group spent three months . We mastered the technology , and , today , we are talking with American companies that are looking to us for other developments , " explains Alexandre Lisboa , a manager of the business unit .
The first innovation by Genius was the automatic assessor for karaoke apparatuses , which gives marks according to the person 's being in tune , loudness and rhythm , in a way that is well ahead of others in the market .
" We put into the apparatus 's software algorithms for parameters of these characteristics , " says Vianna .
Licensed to Gradiente , which is calling it DVD Okê , the new system attracted the attention of five companies from Japan and Singapore that have now begun negotiations with the institute .
To make a complete prototype , Genius owns prototyping machinery to produce the outer casings of the electronic apparatuses .
With the DVD player and the karaoke on the market , although it is premature to claim that there is an industrial recovery , there is a return to a path interrupted with the import of electronic equipment at the beginning of the 1990s .
It was a period in which the Brazilian companies that were developing electronic appliances ( TV , audio , etc . ) , like Gradiente and Sharp , for example , had to reduce or to eliminate their research and development teams and start importing products under license , because they did not have the economic conditions and the techniques to compete with imported products .
The times are certainly different , and nowadays from 80 % to 85 % of a project for electronic equipment goes on the development of the chip .
That is why Genius has eight people trained in chip design .
This way , the institute gains competitiveness and places itself in the global marketing such a way that it now attracts multinationals .
One of Genius 's major areas of business is cell phones .
" It is a world-wide contract , and Siemens has already asked for it to be expanded . "
Besides Gradiente and Siemens , other large companies have now availed themselves of the knowledge generated by Genius .
The area of voice recognition in Portuguese is one of those that have called most attention .
The development of this system has gathered together 30 persons at the institute and is the group with the largest number of researchers .
It is made up of engineers and linguists who have recorded the speech Brazilians from 250 cities , capturing ways of speaking that total over a thousand voice samples .
All this material is being processed and put into software .
Voice recognition may be used in remote controls , a voice portal on the Internet , service centers and air conditioning apparatuses .
One of the companies to use voice recognition experimentally was Deca , a manufacturer of bathroom metals and fixtures .
They used this system to displayin an experimental manner , at the International Fair of the Construction Industry ( Feicon ) , held in São Paulo in April , an intelligent bathroom that answers commands to switch the light on and off , as well as switching the shower on and opening the faucets .
At the 2002 Automobile Saloon , General Motors showed a Vectra model adapted to receiving spoken instructions .
Functions like locking doors , switching on the headlights , switching on the radio , the left or right indicator , were carried out with spoken commands .
In this experiment , the installation of the system in the car was handled by professors and students from the Faculty of Industrial Engineering ( FEI ) , in São Bernardo do Campo ( SP ) .
Partnerships with universities and other research institutes are a priority for Genius .
" It is one of our goals to facilitate the drawing together of the knowledge generated in the universities with the private sector .
" We want to increase our interaction with universities , " says Vianna .
This approach originally began with the Federal University of Amazonas ( Ufam ) .
Many professionals coming from this university were hired , although there was a lack of courses for Genius 's researchers from other cities to be able to carry on their studies , as was the case of dozens of people coming from São Paulo , Bahia , Minas Gerais , Paraná , Rio Grande Sul and Paraíba .
" There wasn 't any course in information technology for a master 's degree in the whole of the northern region , " says Vianna .
" So then we proposed the creation of this course at Ufam , where some doctors who work at Genius give lessons and supervise theses , " Bergerman says .
Forming the team
Genius 's human resources are a separate chapter .
Taking to humid , hot and distant Manaus doctors , masters and graduates from other parts of the country , concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions , could have been a difficulty , but it wasn 't .
The challenge of carrying out research and development in an innovative way weighed heavily in the decisions of those invited.Only 30 % of the members of Genius 's staff are from Manaus , and , even so , a large portion is established in the administrative area .
Amongst the locals from Manaus are physicist Fábio Santos , a Ufam graduate ; Agemilson Pimentel , who did electrical engineering at the Amazonas State University ( UEA ) ; and Jacqueline Aguiar , a recent graduate from the Law course at Ufam .
Santos , another recent graduate , who works in the area of applications for cell phones , says that working at Genius is a unique opportunity for doing technological research in Manaus .
For Pimentel , it was a change of course within the same area .
He used to work in the Sony factory in Manaus and accepted the challenge of the new proposal .
As a lawyer , Jacqueline says that the industrial park , where Genius is installed , does not offer any great attraction .
Family and friends were even surprised that she had accepted working at Genius , instead of a job with the Public Prosecutor 's Office of the State .
" I enjoyed working in a non-profit organization . "
Daniel Gustavo is one of them .
Born inSão Paulo , aged 29 , he worked in two telecommunications companies in São Paulo .
With the privatization of telecommunications , Vianna was a director of operations for Vesper and for Telemar .
" I have always sought technological innovation , and now I have the opportunity for leading this team , which surprises me every day , working with a high technological content . "

Rubber Medicine
Material made from the latex of the rubber tree closes ulcers and rebuilds the esophagus and the eardrum
Dinorah Ereno
The latex extracted from the rubber tree , the raw material , which during the 19th century placed Brazil as the major world exporter of rubber , is the basis of an innovative biomaterial with excellent results for the healing of chronic ulcers and in the reconstruction of perforated esophagi and eardrums .
Developed at the School of Medicine in the town of Ribeirão Preto ( FMRP ) , part of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , the biopolymer should initially be produced by the company Pele Nova Biotecnologia , in a pilot plant installed in the city of Campo Grande , in the state of Mato Grosso .
The company was founded by the Brazilian Academy for Advanced Studies , anon-government organization ( ONG ) maintained by the company Avamax Biotecnologia , which has amongst its members the ex-president of Embraer and Varig , Ozires Silva .
" We make the connection between scientists and investors by showing products with a potential for fighting for a place in the market , " Ozires explained , who has already promoted various meetings between the project 's coordinator , Joaquim Coutinho Netto from the Biochemistry and Immunology Department of FMRP , and parties interested in knowing details of the new product .
The objective of these meetings , at which investors from Germany and Italy have already participated , is to raise the capital necessary to set up the pilot plant and later on an industrial plant .
The pilot plant , scheduled to begin working this coming month of July in an old factory used for the industrialization of heart of palm , and belonging to Avamax , was projected according to the criteria demanded by the National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance ( Anvisa in the Portuguese acronym ) .
The plant will be installed in the industrial district of Ribeirão Preto , previously projected by the now Minister of the Treasury Department , Antônio Palocci , when he was the mayor of the town .
Multinational competition
The biopolymer , which will initially be launched to treat chronic ulcers of the feet and legs , is going to compete with other products from large multinational companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Novartis .
According toCoutinho , the formulae are different , but the results identical .
" This is without saying that the treatment with our product will cost , at least , ten times less , " he says .
" Oneimported 15 gram tube of a healing ointment based on gel with human hormone costs US $ 350 and lasts for only a few days , " Coutinho compares .
The story that led to this biomembrane had its beginning in 1994 when the at that time master 's degree student in the surgery area of FMRP , Fátima Mrué , from the state of Goias who spent two years in Tokyo , Japan , and followed surgery patients with cancer , decided to work on her thesis with the prosthesis of Takimoto , which carried the name of the medical inventor , a compound of silicon and collagen and used to reconstruct the esophagus .
Fátima got in touch with Coutinho in order to know how to obtain collagen from pigskin , a technique described in an article published during the decade of the 60s and which was to be used in the make up of the artificial substitute .
Today , Coutinho states that he had never imagined that that simple question concerning collagen would lead him to weekly meetings with people interested in investing in the biopolymer .
In the end , in order to get rid of the student on that occasion -- today Fátima Mrué is a surgeon at the Oncology Center of the Clinical Hospital of Goiânia -- , Coutinho said to her that if she found the paper he could help her in the job of making a substitute material similar to Takimoto 's .
" A very difficult and painstaking taking task for that time since there was no Internet , " as she herself recalls .
Coutinho , resigned to the fact , decided to help the persistent student in the preparation of collagen from pigskin .
However , on being mixed with silicone , there was no way of making the two materials combine together .
" We couldn 't reproduce the Japanese prosthesis , " Coutinho recalls .
Inspiration in the past
" It was then that I had the idea of making prosthesis from the latex of the rubber tree , " recalls the doctor , probably inspired in memories of the large rubber tree plantations of the small town in the interior of the state of São Paulo where he was born , Guapiaçu .
He thought that it would be much easier to mix the collagen in the milk from the rubber tree .
Fátima didn 't place much faith in the proposed solution , but decided to respect it .
As they were going to need someone who would make the experimental prosthesis , they found in the region of São José do Rio Preto the chemist Antônio César Zabrowski , from the company Globbor , that sells rubber to Goodyear .
Zabrowski offered to manufacture the prosthesis and built them making use of a ribbed glass mold , composed of vegetal latex and 0.1 % collagen or polylysine .
The experimental prosthesis , a tube of 8 centimeters in length by 2 centimeters in diameter was implanted in the esophagus of eight dogs .
However , an uncommon occurrence caught the attention of the researchers .
Ten days after the implant , the prostheses were expelled together with the feces of the animal .
They found this strange and decided to carry out an endoscopy in order to know what had happened , since none of the dogs appeared to be ill .
By the end of the examination both Fátima and Coutinho were surprised with the revelation that , in such a short period of time , a new esophagus had formed in the separated fragment .
In the histological analysis ( an evaluation of the tissue under the microscope ) , it showed itself to be practically equal to the normal esophagus , with all the layers .
" There was practically no scarring and also there was not the formation of fibrosis at the repaired location , showing a process of structural neoformation , " says Coutinho . " The
results were surprising and we decided to investigate the phenomenon in depth , " he explains .
As the histological cut of the material showed the presence of a large quantity of blood vessels at the locality where the prosthesis had been placed , this could explain the process of the accelerated repair ( healing ) .
However , this property of latex to stimulate angiogenesis ( the formation of new blood vessels ) was only discovered because the polymer was not obtained by the traditional method , known as vulcanization , using a temperature of between 110º C to 125º C. Zabrowski had made use of a technique of polymerization under special conditions , developed and patented by him , and later purchased by Avamax .
The proof that the method of obtaining the biopolymer was fundamental to the process of angiogenesis was done when the researchers carried ut tests using surgical gloves and contraceptives that have the same raw material , namely latex , to see how they would behave in the process of healing .
" But these materials didn 't show any angiogenesis activity , " Coutinho says .
Tests were even done using embryonated chickens eggs to evaluate the formation of veins , and with rabbits ' ears , to verify the speed with which the process of healing occurred .
" The application of the biomaterial sped up a structural neoformation process , highly organized and without leaving a scar , " the doctor concludes .
Quick healing
After completing the cycle of tests on animals , the moment arrived to begin an evaluation of the biomaterial based on vegetal latex on human patients .
In 1997 , Coutinho and Fátima submitted to the Medical Ethical Commission of the Clinical Hospital of FMRP a request to begin experiments on humans .
" This authorization was only granted one year later , allowing the student Paulo César Grisotto , who was completing his doctorate degree at that time in Ribeirão Preto , to widen and to advance his studies , dealing with patients with chronic ulcers of difficult healing at the hospital in Itajobi ( SP ) , a town in the region of São José do Rio Preto , " Coutinho says .
" On average , twelve days after starting to use dressings with the biopolymer on the patients , the chronic wounds , mainly with diabetes patients , began to show signs of evident granulation and epithelial formation , as against the six months necessary for traditional methods , that include interning in hospital , " the doctor states .
According to an epidemiological survey carried out in the town of Juiz de Fora in the State of Minas Gerais , by Marco Andrey Cipriani Frade , around 2.7 % of the population has chronic ulcers on their feet or legs , a percentage that reaches as high as 10 % in diabetes patients .
These wounds represent the second highest reason for work absenteeism in Brazil .
Reconstructed eardrum
Six years after Dr. Grisotto had begun to carry out tests on humans , the number of patients studied in the hospitals of Ribeirão , Itajobi , Juiz de Fora and others had reached 3,000 of whom 2,500 had ulcers and the remainder with a perforated eardrum by infection or trauma .
All of the tests were carried out after approval by the Medical Ethics Commission of the respective institutions .
The surgeries to reconstitute the eardrum using a biomembrane of latex were carried out at the Otolaryngology Sector of the Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology Department of FMRP .
This surgery , named myringoplasty , has as its objective the reconstitution of the mechanism of sound transmission .
Various materials are used for this objective , a favorite being the fascia ( a layer of fibrous tissue that covers the body under the skin ) of temporal muscle , cartilage , placental tissue , among others , but the results showed up to 30 % of failure from the anatomic point of view and 19 % of re-perforation mainly caused by the lack of blood vessels in the graft .
On the other hand , the use of a biomembrane from latex showed intense vascularization , as indicated in the work of the otolaryngologists José Antonio Apparecido de Oliveira and Miguel Angelo Hyppolito from USP at Ribeirão Preto named " Myringoplasty Making Use of a New Biosynthetic Material , " presented in 1998 during the 34th Brazilian Congress of Otolaryngology in Porto Alegre .
The team won first place by describing the success of the grafts using the biopolymer .
" We verified intense vascularization in 100 % of the grafts , which is not usual when not using a membrane made from natural latex , " states one of the parts of the prize-winning paper .
The report refers to only nineteen perforated eardrums that received the biomaterial as a transitory implant during myringoplasty .
Today the number of successes has reached five hundred .
Two doctorate theses , developed at the Surgery and Anatomy Department of FMRP , under the guidance of Professors Jesualdo Cherri and Carlos Eli Piccinato , and defended by the vascular surgeons Mário Augusto da Silva Freitas and Paulo Cesar Grisotto , respectively in August of 2001 and February of 2003 , have pointed out , after tests done with animals , that it is possible to recover cardiovascular arteries by way of the use of latex prostheses .
But as yet more experimental work is necessary before making tests on human patients , in order to evaluate the efficiency of this material that could substitute the current synthetic prosthesis or biological material of animal origin , such as the pericardium of the cow or pig .
These pieces of research show that the biopolymer based on vegetal latex could still give origin to many other products , with diverse applications .
The dressings are only the first step for the company Pele Nova Biotecnologia to enter into dispute for a national market estimated at around 4.5 million people , who , most probably , could not pay the very high cost for the imported medicine .

Expanded image
National technology lowers production costs of special lenses made with injectable plastics
Samuel Antenor
Special lenses that make for a better quality of the images in medical magnifying glasses , microscopes , night vision glasses , and even cameras have begun to be produced by Optovac , a small company from Osasco , in Greater São Paulo .
These lenses guarantee high quality images , without the small distortions of conventional lenses .
They are called non-spheric or aspheric , and they can successfully remain in focus in a more efficient way , bringing down to acceptable levels the so-called spherical aberration , the failure in the formation of the image caused by the refraction of the light on spherical surfaces , a physical phenomenon that manifests itself in conventional lenses .
The aspheric ones have a kind of curvature that makes it possible to get sharper images .
They can be made with specific curvatures , avoiding focal problems that jeopardize the visual quality of the image observed .
Started two years ago , the project has resulted in molds for the production of the plastic lenses , a process that should begin in October this year .
From the economic point of view , the mastery of this technology takes on greater importance , to the extent that high quality aspheric lenses in transparent and moldable plastics are of interest to a wide range of industrial uses .
In the medical area , in the magnifying glasses used in various operations ; in the military area , in lenses for night vision ; and in laboratories , in optic microscopes .
But the ordinary consumer may also benefit from the same optic quality of the aspheric lenses put into glasses , leaving them lighter and with the lenses not as thick .
Another use that is already common is in cameras .
The countries that produce this equipment , like Japan and Germany for example , use plastic aspheric lenses in the object glasses in conjunction with lenses of common glass , because they ally focal quality with the material durability .
The problem is that , for cameras , aspheric lenses only acquire competitiveness if they are manufactured on a large scale .
Other areas where these lenses are increasingly sought after and highly competitive are electronics and telecommunications .
They are products that have had their demand increased with the application of optic components in plastic , sophisticated and of a low cost , such as video cameras , light sensors and optical couplings ( connections that join optical fibers together ) .
Another use that is ever more common is in compact disc readers , when the laser beam crosses through the aspheric lens before touching the surface of the CD .
" These are very competitive areas .
I can only see possibilities for us to work in these areas in the medium term , " Nobre reckons .
" Our goal is to work in smaller and more limited niches , which the major manufacturers have no interest in . "
Astronomy and medicine
For Sérgio Nobre , the challenge is to have prices that are compatible with the products from Asia and a better quality .
" Our labor costs and production expenses are higher than those of the Chinese , for example , but we are going to face up to them with technology , " explains the director , who intends to qualify the company for exporting , in particular with products intended for the educational area .
Optovac 's forecast sales for this are between R $ 1 million and R $ 1.5 million , in which the aspheric lenses should have a share of around R $ 100,000 a month , from October onwards .
The secret , in which time and money has to be invested , lies in the mold for the lens that Optovac is developing .
With efficient molding , it is possible to marry the advantages of these lenses with the low cost of injectable plastic .
The data for the manufacture of the molds for aspheric lenses are created and organized on a computer and inserted into an Computerized Numerical Control ( CNC ) Aspheric Generator , equipment used to repeat the manufacture of a product .
It carries out a reading of the information programmed by the software and makes a mold for the lenses , on the basis of a pre-machined piece of glass or ceramic .
To forge the mold , a grindstone goes round the piece , touching its side , which is refrigerated by water and a soluble oil that , besides maintaining its temperature , avoids undue abrasion of the pieces .
After this stage , another apparatus , a profilometer , measures the profile of the semi-finished mold .
If there are differences between the data originally programmed by the computer and the end result , the software generates a correction file and the Aspheric Generator carries out the finishing touch on the mold .
Developing from scratch
Created in 1986 , with the goal of making equipment with technologies involving fine mechanics , Optovac went on to work in the optic segment , with research products for the educational area and for general consumption , such as kits for teaching science , telescopes and microscopes , and they even developed this kind of equipment for research institutes connected with the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) .
However , with a limited commercial field and the opening up of the market over the last decade -- which brought products with more competitive prices to Brazil -- , the company found itself obliged to invest in research and to develop from scratch a technology that already existed abroad .
And why not simply import the technology ?
According to Sérgio Nobre , the reason is simple : the costs of importing come to US $ 2 million -- for a production that caters to the small niches that there are in Brazil -- are far higher than the cost of developing it locally , and are unjustifiable in the light of the small demand in the domestic market .
With the aim of raising the quality of the products at a lower cost , the PIPE project made the company 's technological triumph possible , developing the first prototypes in two years .
Work went on simultaneously on technological development and on possible applications in products .
Optovac nowadays has the capacity to supply the domestic market in a customized fashion , as the consumption of these items is small in Brazil .
" We are producing 20,000 spherical lenses for one customer ( he cannot mention the name of the company , nor the application for this product ) ; and for the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute ( Ipen ) , we have just produced a single lens ( aspheric ) , specially developed for use in this institute 's research , that is to say , we have a differentiated structure that allows us flexibility in production , " says the company 's director .
Optovac is even accredited by the Brazilian Army 's aviation unit for the development ( of aspheric lenses ) and maintenance of optical equipment , such as the night vision glasses , which are currently imported and depend on maintenance outside the country .

Digital scissors
Software generated at UFPE wins market and prevents losses in the paper industry
Verônica Falcão , from Recife
Nothing better and cheaper has yet been found than industrial cardboard packaging , whether it is for packing TV sets , fridges , cans of tomato paste or bottles of detergent .
Although it has been present for many years at the final point of the industrial process , these boxes need constant improvements in their manufacturing particularly to reduce the quantity of leftovers without any loss of quality .
It was thinking of solving this problem in relation to cutting sheets of cardboard that mathematician Sóstenes Lins , a professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , created the Conjug software , already in use in industries from all over Brazil .
The success of this product is one of the most emblematic examples of a study generated in an academic environment that wins market and brings important contributions for the productive system .
The calculations for cutting the cardboard previously used to be done manually .
" All that was used was a calculator and common sense , " Lins reveals .
The difficulty is that there are , literally , billions of possibilities for cutting the large rectangle to which the roll of cardboard is reduced , when used to make boxes .
" And human beings can only arrive at two , three , or ten at the most .
" Conjug is based on an algorithm -- a process for calculating -- conceived in 1986 , in partnership with students for a master 's degree .
A member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences ( ABC ) , he tells how he created the algorithm thinking of reducing the losses of paper .
" I just did not imagine that it was something that was innovating .
In December of the next year , he sold the first version of the software to Klabin 's factory in Pernambuco .
Today , Conjug is used in ten of the company 's units , where they produce pulp , paper and boxes of corrugated cardboard .
Family company
Lins estimates that Conjug is employed in over 10 % of the corrugators in Brazil , a kind of machine that makes corrugated cardboard .
To market the software , the professor set up the LinSoft company , managed by his wife .
His son Lauro Didier Lins , who is studying for a doctorate in Computational Mathematics at UFPE , is responsible for the technical part , along with a sister of the professor , Nadja Lins , an electrical engineer and network administrator at UFPE 'S Information Technology Center .
Besides Klabin 's factories , the software is used in paper industries in the states of Amazonas , São Paulo and Ceará .
Another system created by the mathematician 's team , and one that transcended the limits of the university , is S-Plex , used in cutting coils of steel .
Unlike the cutting of cardboard , in which the sheets are separated for making the boxes , the coil of steel is sliced into strips .
The process is like cutting a Swiss roll .
The software has been in use since November 2002 at Armco , an industrial concern that produces sheets of steel in São Paulo and Manaus .
The man responsible for the company 's Integrated Planning sector , Edson José Lopes , estimates that the use of the system has brought about a 20 % reduction in scrap .
" I am eliminating a critical point by adopting S-Plex , " he sums up .
LinSoft was created in 1992 .
Without any competition , the software went so far as to plan the cutting of cardboard boxes in 20 % of the factories in the country .
" We had no competitors at the beginning , but today they exist , " Lins has found out .
This calls for a constant evolution of Conjug .
Today , it covers work in a network and is not just focused on reducing losses with paper .
It also takes profit into account , since it is capable of planning all the production .
" It is possible to arrange the cutting according to the orders and to their urgency , " Lins explains .
Another variable included in Conjug is the paper inventory .
" Proper planning of production avoids losses and improves productivity , " he adds .
The Lins family company is also developing software aimed at packing boxes .
It is called ExpedPlex , and it plans the way boxes are arranged on pallets , in containers , and on trucks .
Pallets are the wooden platforms on which the cargo is piled up for transport and storage .
The system is based on four algorithms .
One of them generated a publication in the European Journal of Operations Research .
In this case , the objective is to save space .
Sóstenes calculates that the addition of from 5 % to 8 % in the volume stowed trucks generates a saving of one less truck for each 15 to 20 trips .
Another software related to the organization of boxes is PalletZoom , copies of which were acquired by the Bompreço supermarket chain .
The system is capable of defining how best to arrange the packaged products on the pallets .
To do so , the user just has to supply details of the dimensions of the boxes and of the pallets .
The machine calculates how the cargo is to be stowed and provides an illustration of how the boxes should be piled up .
Lins explains that he created PalletZoom not only to make for better storage , but also greater speed in transporting the products , because the arrangement allows for a larger number of boxes on the pallet .
If today LinSoft 's products are in use all over the country , at the beginning Professor Lins had great difficulties , in particular to convince the people from industry to accept the product .
The first company that he tried was Ponsa , of the Klabin group , in Pernambuco , back in 1986 .
" They put me in contact with their branch in Rio de Janeiro .
Afterwards , in December 1987 , we agreed that I would perfect the software and that they would buy a version .
There were more or less six or seven months of development .
Klabin bought the first version of Conjug , but only used the software for two months .
At the time , Lins was not contacted by the company and only found out later that they had desisted .
" Computer were very bad , they had little memory and were slow .
The technology for developing software also left a lot to be desired .
The interfaces were no good , " he remembers .
Even so , the program worked .
" It optimized , it cut down the leftovers , " he guarantees .
After the attempt with Klabin , Lins " forgot " Conjug for three years .
" I took care of my own life , doing theoretical mathematics and publishing my papers , " says he , the author of 30 articles published in scientific magazines with an international circulation .
In July 1991 , technicians from Ponsa once again approached him .
" There was a firm intention of really using the program , and this time it worked out . "
In 1993 , Klabin decided to adopt the software at their factories in Piracicaba and Jundiaí .
" Afterwards , it was the turn of the factory in the city of Rio de Janeiro , in February 1994 .
Then all the branches of the company came , " he tells .
With the success at Klabin , several other companies became interested .
In 2001 , LinSoft was present in over 20 % of the companies in the corrugated cardboard market .
Mathematician Paulo Seixas Avino , a business analysts with Klabin , says that Conjug guarantees agility in the process , reliability in the results , and , above all , a reduction in the losses of raw material , which can reach 2 % of the production .
For Lins , the software 's success is not just related to the theoretical aspect of the product , but also to an interface that is pleasing to use and gives the users confidence .

Lucrative Marriage
A fourteen-year partnership between the university and the company CSN has brought in some US $ 85 million for the company
Marili Ribeiro
The greatest difficulty in very successful partnerships between a university and business , when working together in search of technological innovation , is to quantify the gains .
By the calculations of the gigantic company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional ( CSN ) , the improvement in the productivity of their steel mill at Volta Redonda , in the state of Rio de Janeiro , added to the increase in the quality of the steels obtained there , has resulted in gains in the order of US $ 85 million during the fourteen year period of marriage with the Federal University of São Carlos ( UFScar ) and the São Paulo State University ( Unesp ) of Araraquara .
Profits coming from the application of forty one projects for the implementation of new methodologies and processes after research carried out by the Interdisciplinary Electrochemical and Ceramic Laboratory ( Liec ) , which exists in the two universities , along with CSN 's own Research Center .
For the past three years , this laboratory has made up part of the Multidisciplinary Center for the Development of Ceramic Materials ( CMDMC ) , one of the ten Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers ( Cepids ) that make up part of a special program established by FAPESP .
The gains by the CSN through the innovations represent a considerable volume of money for a country with little tradition in giving incentive towards research development .
This value is even greater if we consider that a good part of this resulted from evolution in refractory ceramics , an input which less than ten years ago weighed heavily on Brazilian imports .
The gains and the reversal of this point in the trade balance were attained thanks to the standards conquered by the Liec and CSN 's researchers , who spread their knowledge all the way through the productivity chain , which stretches from the raw material producers for refractory material manufacture to the steel companies .
Currently , many national companies , as is the case with the company Magnesita from the state of Minas Gerais , have turned into exporters of technology on refractory ceramics using magnesium-carbon and magnesium-carbon-aluminum mixtures .
Everything started with operational difficulties at the blast furnaces , the heart of the business of a steel mill , where pig iron , the stage before steel , is produced .
CSN hired a team of consultants from a Japanese company , who diagnosed a problem of thermal shock in the ceramic burner of the regenerators .
Responsible for the supply of hot air for the blast furnace , the paralysis of the operating of this equipment for repairs , scheduled to last for a minimum of six months according to the Japanese technical team , would have created a drama in the production of the mill .
Frightened when faced by such a prognosis and probable losses -- in the end , the estimation for the repair of the burner was around US $ 15 million -- , the managers at CSN decided to turn to Liec before making a final decision .
Two days of incessant discussions sealed the year 1989 as one of the start of a marriage capable of producing fine fruit .
At that time , after the evaluation of the UFSCar researchers , it was seen that the Japanese consultants had precipitated their analysis .
There was no problem of thermal shock in the refractory material of the ceramic burner , but there was strong corrosion , which could be counteracted by the installation of filters to remove particles of iron oxide coming from the gas of the blast furnace .
Everything was done without ever stopping work .
As he likes to remember , while emphasizing each word with the diction typical of a school teacher , Professor Elson Longo , the director of the CMDMC in São Carlos , underlines : " When we arrived at CSN , they were producing 4 million tons of steel per year .
Today they are producing 5.5 million tons practically with the same equipment .
And this is taking into account that the nominal capacity of the steel mill was only 4.6 million . "
The gain of 1.5 million tons is due to a complete change in the concept of the refractory material during the fourteen years of mutually living together .
The excellence in the mastery of these ceramic materials was made possible by a combination of investments at the Liec in São Carlos .
It was established with resources to the tune of US $ 400,000 , sponsored by FAPESP , the Financier of Studies and Projects ( Finep ) , the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) , the Bank of Brazil , and the Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Metais ( CBMM ) .
And , even attending to the demands of various large industrial groups present in their portfolio of clients , it annually receives only R $ 180,000 of private incentive for its maintenance , which costs around R $ 1.3 million per year .
The bulk of the necessary resources comes from financing agencies .
As well as FAPESP and the CNPq , there is collaboration from the Coordination for the Training of Personnel at Tertiary Level ( Capes ) .
Accumulation of knowledge
In the specific case of the steel mill , the steels gained enormous competitiveness abroad after the incorporation of the technological conquests .
" National steel reaches the United States cheaper that the one produced by them , " informs Longo .
The gains calculated by CSN of US $ 85 million through the partnership are considered to be a conservative estimate .
" This is a number a long way away from reality because only the result obtained during the first year in which the innovation is implemented is considered , without taking into consideration later gains , " the Professor explains .
Today , in a clear sign of the importance of the partnership , CSN keeps an apartment to house the university researchers who spend periods working at the Volta Redonda mill .
They rotate doing research within the mill itself .
Currently there are six doctorate professors , three students researching their doctorate degrees , two on their master 's degree and a further three undergraduates , all involved with projects concerning the mill . " The
contribution in knowledge and ideas by the university is a notable point in our area of research and development , " explains Sidiney Silva from CSN .
" For example , in the steel mill the researchers find instruments and conditions to carry out experiments with pig iron and liquid steel .
We now have a series of simulation plants where they can finalize their studies initiated within the laboratory . "
After starting off by saving the ceramic burner , the Liec researchers , together with those at CSN , introduced various alterations that have guaranteed the performance and the useful life of these blast furnaces , from the change in the refractory material to the manner of manufacturing them .
" Only in the improvement of the conditions of the blast furnaces there were twelve projects linked to operational questions , being that , with just the techniques of the addition of titanium into the melting pot or crucible , the lower region of the furnace where continuously the liquid pig iron that is produced accumulates , they have managed an economy valued around US $ 13 million for the company , " Longo explains .
" The crucible is the heart of the blast furnace .
It is surrounded with refractory blocks made of carbon and its performance is vital for the production of the mill , " says Silva from CSN .
The innovations applied to the crucible after laboratory research resulted , among other advantages , in a reduction of thermal loses during the process , with a consequent saving economy in the reducing agent ( coal that will be turned into coke ) , imported raw materials , used in prolonging the useful life of the equipment .
" The life of a blast furnace , which was on average ten years , is now programmed for twenty , " highlights Longo .
One of the aspects studied in depth was the corrosion present in the coating surrounding the crucible .
" We sought to evaluate the effects of titanium , which , in contact with the carbon and nitrogen of the pig iron and with the calcium oxide of the slag of the blast furnace , brings about the formation of a protective layer on the refractory coating , " Silva explains .
Torpedo carriage
The next material step of introducing technological innovations into the routine of CSN involved the torpedo carriage , given the job of transporting the liquid pig iron of the blast furnaces to the converters where it will be transformed into steel .
One of the problems in the management of this equipment resides in a loss of energy during the filling of the carriage in the blast furnaces and afterwards transporting to the steel plant .
The suggestion by the researchers was the installation of a layer of micro porous silica on the refractory cover of the torpedo carriage .
Immediately there was a decrease of on average 25 ° C in the temperature during the transportation of the liquid pig iron to the steel plant .
The infinity of details of this type of technological marathon by obtaining improved steels has prospered more than just CSN .
Professor José Arana Varela from Unesp , the innovation coordinator at the Ceramic-Cepid informed that the Liec now maintains conventions just as old as that with CSN an example being with the CBMM .
There are other partnerships of long standing , with White Martins for some eight years , and with the Brazilian Industry of Refractory Articles ( Ibar ) , for almost ten years .

Change in production
Some fifty years ago Johanna Döbereiner Began her biology search into nitrogen fixation
Neldson Marcolin
A young Czech researcher , twenty-seven years of age , landed in Rio de Janeiro in 1951 and a little more than ten years later was already one of the main people responsible for an appreciable change in the manner of production of some Brazilian agricultural crops .
A recent graduate in agronomy from the University of Munich , Germany , Johanna Döbereiner ( 1924-2000 ) was hired by the National Service for Agronomy Research , of the Ministry of Agriculture in the town of Seropédica ( RJ ) , and began work on microbiology of the soil supervised by Alvaro Barcelos Fagundes , at that time the director of the unit .
Starting in 1953 , the researcher turned her attention to the area of biology known as nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) .
Johanna 's starting point was her observations concerning bahia grass , which grows everywhere and remains green and flourishing without nitrogenous fertilizer .
During 1958 to 1959 , she published , along with some colleagues a survey on nitrogen fixation in sugarcane in theBrazilian Biology Magazine .
When she exposed her data on the occurrence of these microorganisms in sugarcane , there was some suspicion from the majority of fellow researchers .
" Nobody took me seriously because there was nothing existed on the literature on the description of the association of these bacteria with higher plants , " Johanna said during an interview with the researcher Carlos Chagas Filho ( 1910-2000 ) , published in the bookCientistas do Brasil -- Depoimentos [ Scientists of Brazil -- Statements ] ( Commemorative Edition of the Fifty Years of the SBPC ) .
In 1963 she was asked to participate in the recently founded National Soya Bean Commission .
Right away , she got herself involved in a row : the tendency was to use nitrogenous fertilizers of very high cost .
Johanna insisted that Brazil must wager on the use of bacteria nitrogen fixers and won the discussion .
The result is known : from 1964 , the Brazilian program for soya improvement was completely based on the process of BNF and the country turned itself into the second largest world producer of this grain -- the annual economy using nitrogen fixing fertilizers reaches more than US $ 1.5 billion .
Johanna always worked with The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ( Embrapa Agrobiology with its headquarters in the town of Seropédica ) and afterwards with the Rural Federal University of Rio de Janeiro .
Her studies gained her international recognition -- she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1997 -- and even influenced the main lines of research about this theme in Brazil and abroad .
For example , in May specialists from seven institutions in Rio announced the conclusion of the sequencing ofGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus , one of the bacterium responsible for nitrogen fixing in the sugarcane .
With the information obtained , the researchers will attempt to improve the metabolic performance of the bacterium in order to widen its capability in nitrogen fixation .
New law authorizes research with stem cells and permits marketing of transgenics
Claudia Izique
Sanctioned by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on March 24 , the Law on Biosafety has broadened the prospects for biotechnology in the country : it authorized investigations with embryonic stem cells of human beings and the marketing of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
Ratified by the President of the Republic , the Congress 's decision is a recognition of the capability of Brazilian researchers for doing science on the frontier of knowledge .
The wager on the competence of national research may transform the new law into a tool of technological independence , and , at the same time , guarantee that society will enjoy the results of the investments in science and technology .
The new law will make it possible for at least a dozen laboratories -- many of them now carrying out research with stem cells from the bone marrow and the umbilical cord -- to start their investigations with embryonic stem cells that , in the future , may indicate ways for treating diseases like Parkinson 's , diabetes and spinal cord lesions , among others ( see page 30 ) .
The two lines of research can now count on programmed investments of R $ 28.3 million , according to an announcement by the Minister of Science and Technology , Eduardo Campos .
In the area of transgenics , the researches are more advanced .
The prospects are promising , and they lie in the short term .
In the next harvest , for example , farmers from all over the country will have access to genetically modified soybean seeds developed by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ( Embrapa ) , bringing gains in productivity and income .
Companies like Monsanto , Bayer Seeds and Syngenta Seeds are also ready to place new products on the market ( please see page 34 ) .
Mobilization of researchers -- The procedural course of the law through Congress , until its approval , was marked by intense controversy and called for the mobilization of scientists .
Along with geneticist Mayana Zatz ( see the interview on page 12 ) , Marco Antonio Zago , from the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine and the coordinator of the Cell Therapy Center , and Drauzio Varela , an oncologist , Patrícia took part in public hearings in the Senate and in several encounters with deputies from the Chamber , with the objective of clarifying any of the parliamentarians ' doubts .
The results were worthwhile .
" It was the first time that senators , deputies and scientists joined up .
We won a holy war , " says Darcísio Perondi ( PSDB-RS ) , who drafted the bill in the second round of voting in the Chamber .
The voting of the law also took to Brasilia members of the Pro-Life Movement ( Movitae in the Portuguese acronym ) , which brings together entities that represent patients with neuromuscular diseases and their parents .
Movitae was created in 2003 , when the National Congress was starting the debates on therapeutic cloning , a technique that was left out of the Law on Biosafety .
" On the day of the voting , we brought together in the Chamber about 50 people from the four corners of the country , " says Andréa Bezerra de Albuquerque , Movitae 's president , who remained in Brasilia , on the qui vive , until the presidential sanction .
Amongst the patients mobilized by Movitae were six representatives of the Brazilian Muscular Dystrophy Association .
They circulated through the corridors of the Chamber , crowded the floor on the plenary session , and , along with researchers and deputies , celebrated the approval of the law .
" We asked one of our patients , who is 8 years old , what had pleased him most in Brasilia .
And he replied : the victory , " recalls Munira Tenezi Guilhon Sá , the association 's executive director .
The mobilization of the sick touched the President of the Chamber , Severino Cavalcanti ( PP-PE ) .
He had already shown himself to be against the approval of the subject , alleging religious reasons , in spite of the appeals of his daughter Ana Cavalcanti , who is an occupational therapist and state deputy in Pernambuco .
" Even before his being elected president of the House , I had already been talking to him , to change his mind , " Ana revealed .
Mayana and Patrícia also tried to convince the deputy .
" But what moved my father most was the presence of dystrophy victims and their mothers at the entrance to the plenary , " said Ana .
Cavalcanti put the proposal for debate , prevented the suspension of the session , defended by the opponents of the project , but withdrew before the end of the voting .
Anyhow , the speed with which the Chamber approved the issue surprised the researchers .
Overcoming the Chamber 's resistance , though , was not an easy task .
For religious reasons or for lack of information , many deputies feared that , by authorizing research with stem cells , they would be legitimating the cloning of human beings .
Others went even further : they suspected they were encouraging abortion .
This concern was one of the reasons that led the same plenary to defeat an authorization for research with embryonic stem cells the first time the subject was voted , in February 2004 .
Part of the difficulties in the procedural handling of the project , though , has to be credited to its scope .
The proposal sent by the Executive Branch to the Chamber , in 2004 , sought a definitive solution for the polemics over the planting of Monsanto 's Roundup Ready ( RR ) soybeans , authorized by the National Technical Biosafety Commission ( CTNBio ) , whose competence was contested by a public civil lawsuit .
Amid the juridical imbroglio , there was a shortage of seeds in the domestic market , and the farmers from Rio Grande do Sul bought and planted RR seeds from Argentina .
In the absence of a legal framework , the government had to publish a provisional measure to guarantee the harvesting and marketing of the 2002 / 2003 crop .
The government then set up a commission to draw up a bill , to bring the battle of the transgenic to a conclusion .
It joined up the proposal to the embryonic stem cell issue and sent it to the Congress .
" We thought that it was odd for the project to join the two together , " Mayana recalls .
" The syncretic project was analyzed by a special commission and accompanied closely by researchers and representatives of scientific associations .
The opinion of Deputy Aldo Rebelo , of the Communist Party of Brazil , São Paulo -- which authorized research with stem cells , therapeutic cloning , and the planting and marketing of transgenics -- was already ready to be taken to the plenary when , on the eve of the voting , Rebelo was appointed to a ministry and replaced as the draftsman of the law by Deputy Renildo Calheiros ( Communist Party of Brazil , Ceará ) .
Calheiros prepared his own opinion .
He went so far as to consider the possibility of dismembering the project that dealt with different subjects , but , without backing , he changed his mind .
In the first version of the report , he maintained the authorization for research with stem cells , he says .
" But every proposal has to be negotiated , " he argues .
Faced by the resistance of the evangelical and Catholic benches , in his final report Calheiros vetoed therapeutic cloning and researches with embryonic stem cells .
In the case of the transgenics , he gave way to the pressure of the environmentalists : he limited the competence of the CTNBio to authorizing research , conferring on the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources ( Ibama ) and the National Health Surveillance Agency ( Anvisa ) power to decide about the planting and marketing of GMOs .
The project approved by the Chamber and then sent to the Senate was described as a " juridical Frankenstein " by Carlos Vogt , the president of FAPESP .
The Foundation 's Board of Trustees also manifested itself , appealing to the senators to listen to the arguments of the scientific community .
Another 13 entities , including the Brazilian Academy of Sciences , positioned themselves in favor of researches with stem cells and against the limitation of the competence of the CTNBio .
The Senate heard researchers , held public hearings , and modified the decision of the Chamber .
The report by Senator Ney Suassuna ( Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement , Paraiba ) , with the endorsement of the scientists , maintained the veto on the therapeutic cloning of embryos , but restored the authorization for researches with stem cells and the power of the CTNBio to decide , in the case of the planting and marketing of transgenics .
Information overcame fear , and the project was approved by a wide margin : 53 votes to 2 .
The role of the media -- In the Senate 's decision , it is as well to point out , the mobilization of the media had its weight .
Before the voting , Rede Globo 's Sunday News program -- Fantástico - showed , for three Sundays running , programs from the ' How to build a human ' series , bought from the BBC in London , which addressed the benefits from using stem cells in the treatment of diseases .
The newspaper with the largest circulation in the country , like O Globo , O Estado de S. Paulo and Folha de S.Paulo also manifested themselves , in editorials , against what they described as " obscurantism " and " witchcraft . "
The project , modified , went back to the Chamber , which , in this second round , would only have the power to veto it .
The members of the opposition did indeed try to overturn the text 's article 5 , which authorized researches with stem cells .
With the exception of Prona , Party for the Rebuilding of the National Order , all the parties came out in favor of the text , which was approved by 366 votes to 59 .
The environmentalists tried to restrict the powers of the CTNBio , but the proposal from the Senate prevailed , with the support of 352 votes against 60 .
But it was still early for commemorations .
Approved in the two Houses , the draft law on biosafety was forwarded to the Presidential Chief of Staff for an analysis of its merit , constitutionality and legality , before going for the presidential sanction .
There was a fear that the president might veto some of the project 's articles , under pressure from Catholics and environmentalists .
The worries were not unfounded : one day after approval , the Ministry of the Environment published a note , reiterating its position against the project : the exclusive and binding power over permitting the planting and marketing of transgenics conferred on the CTNBio by the new law would relegate the public bodies that act in the area of the environment to a secondary role .
The government also received manifestations in favor of the project , like those from FAPESP 's Board of Trustees , which , one week after the approval in the Chamber , on March 10 , forwarded a letter to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , asking him to sanction the draft law on biosafety just as approved , " thus laying down the secure foundations , the hopes for a cure and a better quality of life for thousands of people who have experienced and are experiencing the expectations of this great moment . "
In an article published in O Globo , on March 21 , Minister Eduardo Campos stated that the permission for researches with stem cells of human embryos represents " the first great step towards the arrival of the country at the frontier of medicine . "
Now , he said : " the important thing is to recover the lost time . "
And he noted that , sooner or later , Brazil will have to get itself ready for an even bolder step : authorizing therapeutic cloning .
And he made the proviso : " It will be taken when the social and political conditions have matured , representing another landmark in the recognition of the work of Brazilian scientists . "
The Bill on Biosafety is going to boost Brazilian research , which was already strong in the area
Marcos Pivetta
In 1998 , the team led by biologist James Thomson , from the University of Wisconsin , United States , isolated and developed , for the first time in a laboratory , a lineage of stem cells extracted from human embryos .
It was a technical feat and an ethical problem for biological research .
A feat , because the studies with these cells may , in theory , lead to better treatments or to the cure of an almost interminable list of diseases .
If duly cultivated , embryonic stem cells , and only these , can originate all the tissues of an organism , about 220 distinct kinds of cells that would be the raw material for new therapies .
A problem , because the way for getting them offends the belief of portions of society , in particular the religious , and , in some countries , the laws as well : the stem cells are taken out of embryos , which become unviable when they give up this material .
Since then , in several parts of the world , there has been a moral and juridical clash between the defendants and the opponents of this kind of research .
Little by little , with a greater or lesser degree of restrictions , there seems to be a tendency for countries that are strong , or minimally structured , in science to permit experiments with genitor cells ( see table on page 32 ) .
In March , President Lula sanctioned the new Law on Biosafety and broadened the prospects for biotechnology in the country : he authorized studies with human embryonic stem cells and the planting and commercialization of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , two lines of research with investments programmed of R $ 28.3 million , according to the announcement made by the Minister of Science and Technology , Eduardo Campos .
Cardiologist José Eduardo Krieger , from the Heart Institute ( InCor ) , of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) , uses an interesting metaphor for describing the importance of encouraging research in this area .
" Embryonic cells are the only ones that have the complete hardware of the biological computer , " likens the researcher .
" The researches are now going to try to unveil the specific software , the right buttons , that orientate the formation of the various tissues . "
Over the last few years , while work with embryonic stem cells of human origin remained banned , Brazilian scientists did not wait around with their arms crossed .
They did what the legislation allowed : they developed lines of research with animal stem cells and human stem cells removed from adult tissue , generally bone marrow and the blood from the umbilical cord .
A good deal of the studies involved basic biology .
This involves the intuition of trying to understand and control , in vitro , the division and differentiation mechanisms of stem cells and , in certain cases , it involved generating models of animals with some sort of minor lesion .
Others have shown a more applied characteristic , in which possible therapies based on adult stem cells were tested in animals and humans .
There is no irrefutable evidence that adult stem cells can be as flexile as embryos .
However , as each day that passes , it is being discovered that they can be extracted from more mature tissue than had been thought - fat is one of their sources - and they differentiate within a wider range of tissues .
Perhaps they may well form the basis for the treatment of some illnesses , such as cardiac , orthopedic and dental problems .
Less versatile than the embryonic ones , the adult stem cells have one advantage : they seem to be safer .
In experimental therapies , stem cells are injected into patients , and they are usually taken from the patients themselves .
This eliminates the risk of the implanted material being rejected and reduces the occurrence of other problems .
" Many studies show that , in mice , when undifferentiated embryonic stem cells are injected , tumors appear , " says Marco Antonio Zago , the coordinator of the Cell Therapy Center of the Ribeirão Preto Faculty of Medicine , of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) .
" It would be madness to inoculate embryonic cells into humans , before we learn to differentiate them , " says geneticist Mayana Zatz , the coordinator of USP 's Human Genome Study Center , who is researching into the use of cell therapy in muscular dystrophies ( see the interview on page 12 ) .
That is why no serious research group , here or abroad , is cogitating to inject , in the short term , a dose of embryonic stem cells into our species .
In the next two or three years , the most heartening results , in clinical terms , should come from experiments with possible therapies based on adult stem cells , treading a more cautious path .
There is a successful precedent that justifies moderate optimism with this approach .
Of all the promises of cell therapy , only one , for the time being , has become a medical procedure that has become routine in leading hospitals : the bone marrow transplant , used , for 40 years , to treat leukemias , certain kinds of lymphomas , and other blood disorders .
In the " miracle " of the transplant , the " saint " about which almost nobody used to talk until a few years back , is the population of adult stem cells existing in this soft and spongy issue located in the insides of the bones .
There are two kinds of stem cell in the marrow : the hemopoietic ones , which generate the red blood cells , ( erythrocytes ) , the white blood cells and the platelets ; and the mesenchymal ones , capable of originating distinct tissues , like bones , cartilage , tendons , muscles and fat .
In the more basic area , progress may come from the most varied fronts : work with adult stem cells , of human or animal origin , cultivated in the laboratory , or implanted in animals , or even in man ; studies with human embryonic cells in vitro , or injected into animals ; and experiments with embryonic cells from animals .
Some lines of applied and elementary research with stem cells pursued by Brazilian scientists are set out below .
Cardiology - Along with Germany , Brazil is one of the international points of reference in clinical research that uses stem cells from the bone marrow of the patients themselves to treat their heart problems .
In February , delighted with the positive results of pilot studies carried out with a small number of patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction , dilated cardiomyopathy , chronic ischemia and Chagas 's disease , the Ministry of Health launched a R $ 13 million project to research , over the next three years , the effectiveness of the employment of cells from the marrow against these malfunctions that can lead to cardiac insufficiency .
Ambitious , the so-called Randomized Multicentric Study of Cell Therapy in Cardiopathy will be coordinated by the Laranjeiras National Cardiology Institute ( INCL ) , in Rio de Janeiro , and will count on the participation of about 30 universities and hospitals from north to south of the country .
The new approach will be tested on 1,200 patients , split , according to their heart problem , in four groups of 300 individuals .
They will all receive the conventional treatment for their cardiac problem and will be followed up for one year .
To gauge the possible beneficial effects of cell therapy , half of the patients will also be the object of a dose of a placebo ( an innocuous material , without any therapeutic effect ) , and half , of an injection of stem cells into the heart .
The study will be double-blind : doctors and patients will not know who has received what .
For each pathology , there will be a center coordinating the studies .
The INCL will be in charge of the work with dilated cardiomyopathy ( the heart increases in size and has difficulty in pumping the blood ) .
InCor will be commanding the studies with chronic ischemia of the heart .
The Santa Izabel Hospital , of Salvador , in collaboration with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ( Fiocruz ) of Bahia , will supervise the research with Chagas sufferers , without precedent in the world .
The Biomedical Sciences Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( ICB / UFRJ ) , along with the Pro-Cardiac Hospital , will head up the experiments on acute myocardial infarction .
If , at the end of the study , some cell therapy is more benefic than the treatment available today for the problems of the heart , the procedure will come to be adopted by the public hospital network .
" A year and a half from now , we should have the first results with regard to the effectiveness of the use of stem cells from the bone marrow to treat infarction , " reckons Antonio Carlos Campos de Carvalho , from the INCL .
" For the other cardiopathies , we should have to wait about three years . "
In the patients with acute infarction , dilated cardiomyopathy and Chagas 's disease , the cell therapy ( or the placebo ) will be administered by means of a catheter in the coronary arteries .
In the victims of chronic ischemia , people who have had an infarction over six months ago , but continue to have problems of irrigation in the heart , the stem cells will be introduced directly into the cardiac muscle during a surgery to implant a saphenous or mammary bypass graft .
There is great expectation with regard to the tests with seriously ill sufferers from Chagas 's disease who have developed cardiac insufficiency and are candidates for a heart transplant .
Normally , the majority of these patients dies in less than two years .
" In preliminary studies , only two of the 30 patients in which we injected stem cells died , " says Ricardo Ribeiro dos Santos , the coordinator of the Fiocruz Tissue Bioengineering Millennium Institute in Salvador .
" But neither was because of the therapy . "
According to Santos , a good number of the Chagas sufferers showed an improvement in the quality of life and of the cardiac functions .
Two criticisms are being made of the Brazilian studies with cell therapies against cardiac problems .
The first snag : the experiments have made very rapid progress , creating overblown expectations of success for the lay public , before having exhausted all the work with animals and discovered the ideal way of injecting stem cells into the sick .
" Nobody knows what is the best kind of cell for use in the therapies , nor what is the ideal technique for administering them to the patients , " says cardiologist Edimar Bocchi , from InCor , whose work with adult stem cells in cardiac patients is not part of the Ministry of Health 's mega-study .
The second criticism : the researchers do not know the mechanisms that are behind the possible cardiac improvement seen in the preliminary studies .
Up until now , there is no certainty as to whether the bone marrow cells benefit the heart because they increase its vascularization , create more cardiac muscle , or remove damaged cells from the heart .
" We only decided to do tests on humans after having worked with animals and being convinced that the risks from the employment of stem cells are lower than the benefits , " ponders Radovan Borojevic , from the ICB / UFRJ , one of the researchers heading the researches with stem cells in cardiology .
Be that as it may , the Brazilian work was authorized by the National Council of Ethics in Research ( Conep ) and is forming a school abroad .
The Texas Heart Institute recently began a clinical test with stem cells from the bone marrow , inspired on the Brazilian studies .
Thirteen patients were given the alternative therapy , and the results are heartening .
Diabetes and autoimmune diseases - The effectiveness of the employment of adult stem cells for controlling disorders originating in the patients ' own immune system is now being tested in Brazil .
The group led by researcher Júlio Voltarelli , from USP 's Cell Therapy Center in Ribeirão Preto , has , for example , carried out 30 transplants of stem cells from the bone marrow in people with multiple sclerosis , 15 in victims of rheumatic diseases , and 5 in type 1 diabetics ( who need to take insulin in their daily lives ) .
Before being given the therapy , administered intravenously and with cells previously taken from the patients themselves , those taking part in the study were submitted to sessions of chemo- or radiotherapy , to eliminate from the organism the cells of the defense system , responsible for unleashing the autoimmune diseases .
" There were five deaths of people with rheumatic diseases , and four from multiple sclerosis , as a consequence of complications , usually infectious , of the therapy , " Voltarelli claims .
" There were no deaths amongst the diabetics . "
The patients who survived either improved or had their diseases stabilized , an indication that the stem cells may have helped in the reconstitution of a healthier immune system .
Now , the group from Ribeirão Preto is going to start , in partnership with the Albert Einstein Hospital , in São Paulo , and the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) , a project for transplanting adult stem cells in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( a neurodegenerative disease ) .
Dentistry - Teeth derived from the cultivation of adult stem cells ?
At least in animals , producing a canine or molar tooth is almost a reality .
In July last year , a couple of dentists from the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) , Silvio and Monica Duailibi , published an article in the scientific magazine Journal of Dental Research , n which they described the formation of primitive teeth , following the cultivation of stem cells taken from the milk teeth of rats with an age of 3 to 7 days .
The researchers fostered the growth of the cells in a medium rich in a biopolymer and implanted them in a much vascularized region of the animals ' abdomen .
After three months , dental coronas began to form there .
Before this study , a group of researchers from abroad had already achieved the same feat , except in pigs .
Run in collaboration with scientists from the Forsyth Institute , in Boston , and from the Massachusetts General Hospital , the experiment with the rodents was done during a spell when the Brazilians were studying in the United States , and it earned the multinational team a patent .
Today , back in Brazil , the Duailibis have achieved similar results in the laboratories at Unifesp .
And they did not stop there .
" We made teeth grow in the jawbone of rats , using the animals ' stem cells , " tells Monica , who should shortly be publishing an article on the new work .
The next step is to try to cultivate , still in rodents , adult cells taken from human teeth .
" We are going to exhaust all the research with animals before starting tests with human beings , " Silvio says .
Neurology - Some research groups in the world have produced , in animals and in vitro , nerve cells from stem cells , a feat that increases the hope of one day finding a cure for the neurodegenerative diseases , like Parkinson 's disease .
In Sweden , scientists have reverted symptoms of Parkinson 's using a scarce and polemical matrix of biological material , stem cells taken from aborted fetuses , which have the capacity of transforming themselves into neurons .
That is why science is seeking other sources of stem cells equally capable of transforming themselves into brain cells .
Luis Eugênio Mello , from Unifesp , tried to produce neurons from the cultivation of stem cells taken from the blood of the umbilical cord .
He succeeded , but the number of neurons obtained , small , did not overjoy him .
" This is not good material for getting nerve cells , " says Mello , who intends to work , in the short term , with a human strain of embryonic cells imported from the United States .
Neuroscientist Rosalia Mendez-Otero , from UFRJ , tells a similar story .
She has taken neural stem cells from the brains of rats and mice and cultivated them until they became neurons .
The process , though , was very slow .
" It would take from 12 to 1q5 days for the cells to divide and produce neurons , " Rosalia comments .
With the embryonic stem cells , getting neurons can be a quicker process .
In a more applied line of research , the scientist from UFRJ is testing the use of cells from the bone marrow to revert the symptoms of a stroke .
The result with the first patient was good .
" Now we are going to test the therapy on another 25 persons , " explains Rosalia .
Basic research - Since the end of last decade , Lygia da Veiga Pereira , the head of the Molecular Genetics Laboratory of the Biosciences Institute ( IB ) of USP , has been a pioneer in the country in establishing lineages of embryonic stem cells from mice .
In 2001 , anchored on this knowledge , she produced the first Brazilian transgenic mice , guinea pigs that had one gene modified and which could be animal models for studying diseases .
Like other Brazilian researchers , Lygia learnt , in animals , to master some chemical recipes that steer the process of differentiating embryonic stem cells .
" To induce the production of neurons , we add retinoic acid to the culture medium , " exemplifies the researcher from IB / USP .
" To get blood , we put in some interleukins ( a family of proteins ) . "
Logically , the process of cell culture is not as simple as that , but today one knows at least that some ingredients are indispensable for inducing the stem cells to generate certain kinds of tissue .
Before the end of this year , Lygia should start work with imported human embryonic stem cells .
In Ribeirão Preto , the group led by Dimas Covas , from USP 's Cell Therapy Center , has already mastered a good part of the process of transforming mesenchymal and hemopoietic stem cells , the two main kinds of genitor cells present in the human bone marrow , into several tissues , like bones and blood .
They also know how to take mesenchymal cells from various sources .
" You can get these cells from veins and arteries and from the blood of the umbilical cord , " explains Zago , the coordinator of the center .
One of the main objectives of his studies is to map out which genes are activated during the process of transforming the stem cells from the bone marrow into more specialized tissues .
Basic research is costly , time-consuming , and intricate .
As times polemical , as in the case of the stem cells taken from human embryos , or without the results expected a priori ( gene therapy , for example , is a promise that has not yet been fulfilled ) .
But without investment in science , no one is not going to arrive at new treatments .
Do you want one example that it is worth investing in the progress of knowledge ?
Last month , scientists from the University of Wisconsin , them again , developed a way of cultivating embryonic stem cells of human origin , without the need for keeping them in contact with biological material taken from mice .
An important step for producing lineages of embryonic stem cells not contaminated by animal cells , an indispensable condition for their use in humans .
CELLS OF DISCORD
Some countries have recently created laws that lay down the rules for research with stem cells taken from human embryos and so-called therapeutic cloning .
Since the beginning of 2002 , research with embryonic stem cells specially created for this purpose has been permitted .
Therapeutic cloning is also authorized , proved that it uses embryos that have lived 14 days at the most .
Two teams have now been given the green light to clone human embryos for therapeutic purposes .
South Korea
In February 2004 , a South Korean team was the first in the world to clone human embryos and to take embryonic stem cells from them .
It was , however , only at the end of last year that the Seoul government officially defined its policy for the sector .
Research with embryos and therapeutic cloning were approved .
Japan
Although there is no law regulating the subject , in July last year the Ministry of Health authorized researches with embryonic cells and therapeutic cloning .
Brazil
The Law on Biosafety legalizes research with embryonic stem cells taken from surplus embryos , not used for reproductive purposes by couples with infertility problems , provided that they have been frozen for three years .
There has to be consent from the couple that generated the embryos for them to be set aside for science .
Embryos unviable for human reproduction may also go for research .
Therapeutic cloning is prohibited .
United States
Since August 2001 , President George Bush only sets aside federal budgetary funds for studies carried out with the few lineages of embryonic stem cells that had been created up to that date .
But the states have the autonomy to create their own laws , and private enterprise may also finance the researches .
Last year , California approved US $ 3 billion for studies with embryonic cells and therapeutic cloning .
France
In August 2004 , a revision of the law on bioethics authorized , for a five-year period , research to start with embryonic stem cells using surplus material kept in artificial reproduction clinics .
Therapeutic cloning continues to be prohibited .
Germany
Authorizes research with embryonic cells , provided that the lineages studied have been brought from abroad and were created before January 1 , 2002 .
Authorization has to be applied for to import the lineages .
Strictly speaking , the law makes it inviable to carry out research in this area .
In practice , researches with embryonic cells are not authorized .

Heterodox model
The university reform proposal changes bureaucratic structures without defining what the country wants from these institutions
Fabrício Marques
What is the use of a university ?
The draft copy of the pre-project Tertiary Education Law that the federal government presented to the country gives a reply that is hardly orthodox to this question .
The text , submitted to intensive debate during the months of February and March , is laconic when dealing with the intrinsic powers of the tertiary level institutions , such as research and the production of knowledge , but bends over backwards through one hundred articles , about concepts such as social responsibility ( providing service to the local community and the external control of academic activities ) , democratic management ( the participation of students , employees and professors when choosing management ) and the reserve of places for students from state schools .
The proposal has brought about energetic reactions .
In the role of enthusiasts we have those who manage federal universities .
The explanation : the project slackens the budgetary tourniquet to which they had been submitted over the last few years .
According to data from the National Association of Directors of Tertiary Level Federal Institutions ( Andifes in the Portuguese acronym ) , during the period 1995 to 2001 , the fifty four ( 54 ) federal institutions lost 24 % of their monthly provisions budget ( water , light , telephone , purchase of office materials , etc . ) and 77 % of their budgetary resources for investing in classrooms , laboratories , computers and books .
The project removes the weight of their pension payments from their payroll , guaranteeing a greater volume of resources and conceding financial autonomy to these institutions , although it does not point out where the extra money will come from or give an indication as to how the resources will be divided up among the units .
Acid criticism came from the private universities and colleges , which would be submitted to restrictive norms that , among other control mechanisms , would limit the participation of those who sustain these universities to 20 % of each institution 's upper management board -- the other 80 % would come from representatives of the professors , students , employees and the local community .
There was a consensus of opinion that the federal universities had needed help , and also , as had been expected , a more rigid regulation for the private institutions was needed after the extraordinary expansion of that system during the decade of the 90s .
But the passion with which these two topics have been dealt with blurred the central point , namely : what is the type of university being proposed by the Ministry of Education ( MEC ) ?
The main criticism of the project is that the Brazilian university is much more complex than the law framework drawn up by the federal government supposes .
" If it had been to solve the problem of the federal universities , the MEC could well have presented an organic law for the universities .
A university reform is not urgent and deserves much more reflection , " says the rector of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) , Adolpho Melfi .
Marcos Macari , the rector of the São Paulo State University ( Unesp ) , agreed : " The proposal is full of good intentions , such as the autonomy of management of the federal universities and an increase in the number of students from state schooling .
But there is a very poor and long-winded text that deals with questions already covered in the recent Law of Directives and Educational Bases and ignores the reality of the state and municipal public universities . "
Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz , who is leaving the rectory of the Campinas State University ( Unicamp ) to take over the position of FAPESP 's scientific director , complemented : " There 's a lack of strategy .
The proposal doesn 't contemplate the production of knowledge and values too much community extension , in a utilitarian vision that belittles the university . "
In the worst of situations , the universities run the risk of channeling resources and efforts in order to comply with the goal of the expansion of places and new takes of assisting the community , thus sacrificing research .
The minister of education , Tarso Genro , rejects this possibility .
He points out that the reform establishes the requirement , to be complied with within a period of six years , of a teaching staff with a minimum of 50 % of masters ' and doctors in the classrooms and at least one third of the teaching body being of exclusive dedication .
And says that there is the targeting of specific resources in the budget for quality projects and the expansion of teaching and research .
Repeatedly , minister Genro says that he is willing to correct ambiguities in the next version of the project , which will be published in the middle of April for a new round of discussions .
" The only points that are non-negotiable are autonomy , the expansion of places without a lowering of quality and the reserved places for pupils state schools , " the minister says .
" In the new edition of the text , there should be more explicit information on the role of research as an intrinsic university activity , " concedes Fernando Haddad , the Ministry of Education 's executive secretary .
There are signs that other points , such as the generic subjection of support foundations to the norms of the pre-project , will also be revised .
This demand was the reason for a motion coming from FAPESP 's Board of Trustees , signed by the president , Carlos Vogt , which was sent to the MEC : " One point in particular called the attention of FAPESP 's Board of Trustees : that of section III of the first article 1 which , even when fashioned under the form of ' in the situations that fit ' , submits the development institutions to research , in a general manner , and , in our evaluation , unduly , to the treatment of the same pre-project law , which by being unique and by dealing with such diverse material , runs the risk of being dangerously all embracing or of being particularly innocuous in material that has its own specifications and that , in the case of the FAPs , already constitute the objective of institutional and legal regulation in many of the States in the country . "
The modified text should include forgotten themes such as arrangements for distance learning and financial assistance to students .
In the same way , it should have some softening towards the privately owned faculties .
The participation of foreign capital in these institutions is going to be increased from 30 % , in the current text , to 49 % .
The change makes up part of the strategy of turning the pre-project more palatable for the National Congress , which will be presented with the definite proposal starting from June of this year .
" Internal corporations " -- Nevertheless , the project 's essence is likely to be maintained , with its impact upon the daily administration of universities .
One of the most controversial points is the establishing of a social community board , composed of members of the civil society , of government and of the institution itself , " responsible for the supervision and accompaniment of its activities " and for the elaboration of " assistance with the university 's general policy . "
The fear is that this organ hamstring academic autonomy , placing the institution at the service of group interests that do not have a notion about the complex tasks faced by a university .
Even those who defend the project see inconveniences .
" Such a board can 't have the function of supervising the university 's activities , as is indicated in the proposal from the Ministry , " says Ana Lúcia Almeida Gazzola , the rector at the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) and the president of the National Association of Directors of the Federal Institutions of Tertiary Teaching ( Andifes ) .
The ex-minister of education , Paulo Renato Souza , considers that the problem lies not in the boards itself , but " the threat that it would be dominated by internal corporations . "
The Brazilian Association of Sciences ( ABC in the Portuguese acronym ) is proposing to the MEC the substitution of the social community board with a development board , with external and community participation and attributions analogous to the trustees of the American and European institutions , which provide external legitimacy to the authority of the university managers .
Another control mechanism proposed is the institutional development plan ( PDI ) , which the universities must present every five years , with objectives and teaching , research and extension goals .
The extension and community support activities conquered unprecedented relevance in the text that came from the Ministry of Education , returning back to the formation of the professional framework " whose aptitudes should be specifically directed towards attending to the needs of economic , social cultural , scientific and regional technology developments , or of the specific demands of groups and social organizations , including within the working , urban and farming world , directed towards the regime of cooperation . "
" Up until this project , we had judged that social interest or the social responsibility of university institutions in their collective grouping consisted in the formation of qualified personnel , through quality teaching , in the development of knowledge through research , and in extension , that is , in the promotion of access to knowledge that they hold in custody and produce for the sectors of society that desire it and wish to be benefited , " observes the ex-secretary of Educational Policy of MEC , Eunice Durham .
" In the new conception , added to this are a series of other finalities , formulated in an ambiguous manner , undercut in terms of social responsibility . "
Other criticisms refer to the proposed methodologies , not to the objectives .
The text institutes direct elections for the choice of a rector .
Today such elections have only an indicative character .
The University Board , composed by 70 % of the professors ' representatives , determines the names ( almost always respecting the result at the polling booths ) and sends it the head of the Executive Board , whose responsibility it is to make a nomination .
Direct democracy , observes the ex-rector of USP , Jacques Marcovitch , at the recent conference of USP 's Advanced Studies Institute , would distance the choice of its main objective , which is to select for the post someone with merit and administrative capacity .
And opens the door for " political parties to take over the academic world . "
Marcovitch coordinated the study that surveyed the working of the electoral system in twenty-seven important foreign universities .
The study concluded that the ideal situation is halfway between direct election and the choosing , behind closed doors , of a Board that is not always representative .
" The scenario of the direct election for the rector would be a wide-open doorway for the rigging of the public university .
Through it would enter ideological groups in search of strengthening their hand .
Right wing groups as in the time of the military dictatorship or groups from various matrices as in today 's world .
Pernicious all of them for university interest , because they see politics in first place and not the issues relevant to the academic world , " explains Marcovitch .
Minister Tarso Genro considers the reaction of the academic community to such a concept to be exaggerated .
He argues that university boards will have autonomy to define the rules of the electoral process and to avoid abuses .
For Unicamp 's rector , Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz , the proposal breaks a highly desirable state of equilibrium .
" The university belongs to society , not to the corporate groups that make up society .
The chief of the Executive , who was elected by the people , must maintain the prerogative of making the nomination , after having listened to the academic community , " he says .
The proposal for the reserve of 50 % of places for students coming from state schools ( and to establish quotas for Afro-descendents and the indigenous population , obeying these proportions in the population of each state ) brings with it the uncertainty that merit stops being the guiding light for entry into university and that the quality of the teaching will be suffocated by students with serious gaps in their schooling .
" The idea will be to establish the main goal and to give autonomy to the universities to comply with these objectives , " says rector Adolpho Melfi , from the University of São Paulo .
" For example , we could identify the best students from the state schools right at the start of high school , invest in their formation and help them to gain entry via the university entrance exam , " suggests Melfi .
He cited the legal obligation of linking 30 % of the vacancies in the São Paulo universities to evening courses .
" Each institution adapts itself in an autonomously .
The law doesn 't say how they must do it , but only defines the objectives , " he says .
For the president of the SBPC , Ennio Candotti , the question of quotas is badly formulated .
" In the overall balance , we 're not far off the mark of 50 % of the places being taken up by students from state schools .
The question is that , in the highly disputed college , their index is laughable , whilst in courses such as that of pedagogy it 's very high .
We need to find some way of giving them access to all of the careers . "
The question of quotas aroused a collection of collateral criticisms .
One of them is that the pre-project is silent about the root cause of the problem , which is the deficient quality in primary and high school teaching .
" It 's an error to carry out a university reform without linking it directly to a reform in basic education .
You don 't have a good university coming from poor high school teaching , " ponders the senator and ex-minister of education , Cristovam Buarque ( PT-DF ) .
Equally the project ignores evening courses , essential for the students who need to work during the day .
" This is a revealing issue on the absence of a prior debate concerning the university that the country needs .
This is just happening now , " says the SBPC 's president , Ennio Candotti .
Also it is said that the project is timid in fixing goals and wishy-washy in demanding performance .
In the third Article , sector VII , the text establishes as a goal that the public universities will be responsible for 40 % of the places in the tertiary education system by the year 2011 .
In the middle of the decade of the 60s , public institutions were responsible for 65 % of the enrollments in tertiary education and the private teaching institutions had 35 % of the enrollments .
Today the picture has been turned upside down , with the public universities responsible for 30 % of the enrollments and private teaching institutions with 70 % .
Compared to the reality of other countries , the objective of reaching 40 % is not very ambitious .
In the United States 77 % of enrollments are linked to public institutions .
In European countries it goes as high as 90 % .
" If the project had taken as an objective , for example , guaranteeing that in fifteen ( 15 ) years 50 % of the Brazilians between eighteen and twenty four years of age would frequent an institution qualified to tertiary level education , then 50 % of those in public institutions would have a goal , " wrote rector Brito Cruz in an article published in the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo .
" Let 's say that , in the same fifteen years , if you wish , for example , to have fifteen universities to be included in the top five hundred ( 500 ) most important in the world , instead of the four ( 4 ) as we currently have .
It would also be desirable to have 50 % of the vacancies at the federal public institutions in the evening period instead of the 25 % that we have today .
Once the goals were established , it would be necessary to specify the means for hitting them .
After all of this , then we would arrive at the moment of comparing alternatives , in accordance with the result and with the cost , and then to create the legal instruments so that the Brazilian State goes after and attains these goals and generates the means to do it . "
There are those who doubt that the government can manage to attain the goals that it has established .
It so happens that the project forecasts , in the longing for expansion , the reproduction of the model of the federal universities , with research , teaching and an extension program .
" This is a highly expensive model and it 's unlikely that there will be money for this , " says the rector of Unesp , Marcos Macari .
" We could well widen much more the access to tertiary level education by proposing different models , such as those of technological schools .
And consequently not deal with a reduction in quality .
Today many students spend five or six years at a university and then are underused by the labor market .
They could well have taken a shorter course and then later gone back to specialization , " he affirmed .
" Of five year courses or of lesser duration , or of technological faculties ?
It 's good when different models exist , but they are not forecast in the project , " he points out .
Recently the government seized upon provisional decrees in order to make important changes , an example being the alteration in the system of evaluating tertiary education , and more recently , of the University for All Program ( Prouni ) , an unprecedented initiative that guarantees study grants in private universities for students with a low family income .
Only now have they managed to present a package of changes .
The government 's challenge is to convince society and the National Congress that its heterodox model of the university is the most adequate for the country .
For the physicist Luiz Davidovich , a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences , the university needs to be reformed in order to overcome obstacles such as obsolete curriculae , the low number of young people enrolling in tertiary education , the meager demand for qualified professionals and the deficiencies in the primary and high school sectors .
But , in his opinion , the major error is to discuss bureaucratic structures before defining what is expected from the institutions .
" There 's a lack of glamour to the debate of university reform , " he says .

Pasteur 's Quadrant
A book translated by Unicamp examines a pact between the scientific community and the government
Claudia Izique
The pact between science and the government signed at the end of the Second World War and founded on the idea of the dichotomy between basic and applied research has lapsed .
A new model of the relationship between science and technology must be conceived in order to reestablish the dialogue between the communities of the scientists and the politicians .
This new model must reserve a " critically important " role for basic research inspired by the use that brings together the promises of scientific investigation and the needs of society .
These three proposals - intriguing within themselves - form the central axis of the book Pasteur 's Quadrant - basic science and technological innovation , by Donald E .
Stokes , published in1996 by The Brooking Institution Press and re-launched by Editora Unicamp as part of the collection Innovation Classics .
The book 's major merit , nevertheless , lies in the Olympic-like incursion of Stokes into the history of science , by way of intellectual history and by the classifications of research activities , since the time of classical antiquity , in order to understand the relationship between science and technology .
For Stokes , the dichotomy between basic science and applied science consolidated itself in the post war period , when , in the United States , there was a search for maintaining federal support for basic science at a time of peace and , at the same time , a restricted control by the government concerning the research itself .
This strategy inspired the document entitled Science , the endless frontier , put together by Vannevar Bush in 1945 , at the request of president Franklin Roosevelt , who proposed the establishing of the National Research Foundation ( NRF ) .
Indeed , this organizational concept also served as the model for FAPESP , founded in 1960 .
Bush defended the organizational autonomy of the NRF in relation to the government with two basic arguments : one , that basic research must not to tied into practical ends and the other was that it is the forerunner of technological development .
The idea of the creation of an autonomous agency was vetoed by the then president Harry Truman , but the paradigmatic and linear vision of the relationship between basic research and innovation fought for by Bush triumphed and was endorsed by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , established five years later .
Over decades the linear model , with some variations , was a reference point for research and development .
However , in author Stokes ' evaluation the promise of the technological return of investments in pure research no longer has sufficient force to open up the federal coffers , and the pact between science and the government must therefore be revised .
Stokes proposes a new classification of the activities of research and innovation , inserting the activities of research between two coordinates : the first that gives dimension to the advance of knowledge and the second to its application .
Projected in a graphic form , basic research without any immediate application - which has as its best example the investigations by the physicist Niels Bohr about the structure of the atom - occupies the upper left hand quadrant ; applied research looking towards technological development - such as the electrical lighting system of Thomas Edison - inserts itself in the lower left hand quadrant .
In the upper right hand quadrant there is the place for research that could contribute to the advance of knowledge - an inherent quality of basic research - and at the same time that there are major prospects of practical applications .
The investigation by Pasteur in the area of microbiology - that made advances in knowledge and benefited the producers of alcohol from sugar beet - is the best-known example .
And in this region of the confluence of the principles of basic and applied research -Pasteur 's Quadrant - that Stokes inscribes basic research inspired by the use that , in order to put in motion the acquired knowledge and to attend to the demands of society , could serve as the basis of the new pact between the scientific and political communities .
Stokes reserves the lower left hand quadrant for research that is boosted by the investigator 's curiosity about facts that he qualifies as " private , " as , for example , is done by those who observe birds .
For Stokes , the way out of this impasse to which the relationship between science and government has reached , lies in strengthening pure research in the scientific fields that take into consideration society 's needs such as is the case , for example , of investigations into the environment .
Support for research inspired by social objectives does not distract the attention - nor the public resources - of pure research , underlines Stokes .
On the contrary : it strengthens the " cause " of public investments , since it increases the capacity of this area of investigation as a whole .
Nevertheless , it demands an institutionalized effort on the part of the government , by way of the construction of agendas of research funded by agencies that have to consider the needs of the nation .
Part of FAPESP 's investments can be interpreted in the light of the Stokes ' classification within the Pasteur Quadrant , as is the case , for example , of the Genome Programs and the Biota Program .
Author Stokes ' model takes as its reference the North American scientific and technological policy .
However , it could well serve as the inspiration for countries that attempt to trace out a sustainable path in the direction of innovation .
Technology and Development
Within the Innovation Classics collection , published by Editora Unicamp , a further two books concerning the analysis of technological development have been launched this year .
In Paths of Innovation : Technological Change in 20th -Century America , David C. Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg analyze the institutionalization of the inventive process , which brought close together organized innovative research and the contribution of some technological changes - such as , for example , the internal combustion engine - towards economic growth .
In Technology , Learning and Innovation : Experiences of Newly Industrializing Economies , the organizers Linsu Kim and Richard R .
Nelson bring together ten essays and four author commentaries that analyze the progress of technologically backward Asiatic countries .
The book even paints a comparative picture between the economies of the recently industrialized Eastern Asia to that of Latin America .

Lack of sleep activates sexuality , increases the sensitivity to pain and damages the liver and heart
Ricardo Zorzetto
Monica Levy Andersen knows very well the importance of a good night 's sleep .
Even so that she sacrificed hours of precious sleep during months and months in order to dedicate herself to her recent passion : to investigate how long periods of sleep deprivation affects the human organism .
From October of 2002 until February of 2003 , researcher Monica got up from Monday to Saturday at 5 : 30 am and before seven o ' clock she was already in her laboratory with dozens of rats preparing for the first experiments of the day .
In a small room of the Sleep Laboratory of the Federal University of Sao Paulo ( UNIFESP ) , this biomedical researcher accompanied , during these months , the behavior of rodents kept awake for four days in a row .
Her initial goal was to investigate the origin of their aggressiveness and agitation from the lack of sleep , observed for the first time at the end of the 70s by the medical doctor Sergio Tufik , today one of the main specialists in sleep disturbances in the country .
At the head of the Sleep Studies Center , Tufik is coordinating a series of research studies that are mapping out sleep disturbances , capable of bringing about damage to the neurons and to organs such as the liver and the heart .
Monica observed an unexpected effect that - at first appearance - could excite young men , as well as question the current knowledge surrounding sex hormones .
After having taken the rats from inside a tank with water in which the rats balanced themselves upon dry platforms - if they were to fall asleep they would fall into the water and awake - and transfer them to their individual cages , she noted that half of the animals had a spontaneous erection and ejaculation before falling asleep , even without any female rat close by .
" As sleep deprivation affects the working of an area of the central nervous system associated with pleasure , I found in this effect the opportunity to evaluate if drugs such as cocaine , marijuana , and amphetamines improve sexual performance as their users have claimed , " says Monica .
Called hyper-sexuality , this increase in interest for sex became even more intense when the biomedical doctor injected cocaine or ecstasy into the rats , drugs that act upon the pleasure center of the central nervous system .
All of the animals that received one of theses two compounds had an erection - in many cases there were multiple erections .
Before some imprudent big grown up boy attempts to repeat this experiment , one needs to make it clear that this effect is apparently only of temporary benefit .
The continued use of cocaine causes sexual impotence and the prolonged deprivation of sleep generated a biological imbalance in the organism capable of leading to death .
The in-depth study of this effect has rendered to thirty-one-year-old Monica enviable scientific production .
There are some thirty four ( 34 ) scientific articles , twenty of them already published and the remainder to come out soon , all surrounding her doctorate thesis of five hundred pages written over a three year period with funding from FAPESP .
This work may permit her to arrive at a possible explanation for this hyper-sexuality in the face of the forced sleep deprivation : they would be a type of compensation for the erections that occurred during sleep that the rat did not have whilst it remained awake .
Some mammals , amongst them rats and male human beings , have spontaneous erections in the most peculiar of the five phases of sleep the REM ( Rapid Eyes Movement ) sleep , when the muscles associated with voluntary movement remain paralyzed and when dreams occur .
In this phase the central nervous system finds itself as active as when the subject is awake , which is the reason why the REM is also called the paradox of sleep ( up until eighty years ago it had been thought that the brain activity was less during sleep ) .
Some five years ago the medical doctor Markus Schmidt , from the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute , in the United States , proposed that these erections , associated with REM sleep , had a biological function : they served as training for copulation , since , at least in nature , survival depends on efficient reproduction and encounters for mating are unpredictable .
Therefore , one needs to be prepared .
These indications led Monica and her work supervisor Sergio Tufik , to think about hyper-sexuality as a second effect of the same cause : just like the person who does not close their eyes for an entire night needs more sleep hours the following morning - this is the so-called sleep rebound - , the same thing happens with the spontaneous erections of REM sleep .
The most important point in this series of studies is to indicate that an imbalance in the levels of chemical messengers of the central nervous system - the example of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin , upon which react cocaine and ecstasy respectively - is associated to erectile dysfunction of neurological origin .
Set in motion by the alteration in the rhythm of liberation of these neurotransmitters in the regions of the encephalon linked to sexual desire and emotions , this form of erectile dysfunction is different from that of physical origin , brought about by insufficient blood irrigation of the penis .
" Possibly desire and sexual performance depend upon all of the neurotransmitters being found at adequate levels within the central nervous system , " the researcher says .
Progesterone and erection - Through the blood analysis of the animals , Monica made another intriguing discovery , capable of influencing the therapies for erectile dysfunction in human beings .
She verified a brutal reduction in the blood levels of the hormone testosterone .
Found in concentrations twenty times greater in males than in females , this hormone is generally associated with sexual desire and an erection .
Four days after the beginning of the experiment there was a decline of around 90 % in the level of testosterone in the non-sleeping rats , whilst the levels of the hormone progesterone , responsible for the preparation of the uterus for the implantation of the fetus and for the development of the mammary glands during pregnancy showed a level five times above that expected .
Had the deprivation of sleep , therefore , brought about a type of pregnancy in the male rats ?
Clearly not .
Monica believes in a redefinition of the roles .
The progesterone hormone would be performing in the masculine organism a function previously attributed to testosterone , to allow for a penis erection , whilst the testosterone would respond to the intensity of the libido .
In search of confirmation , Monica gave on its own testosterone , progesterone or estradiol to distinct groups of rodents , which had gone through four days without sleep and then had received cocaine - different from previous studies , these animals had been castrated and their organisms practically no longer produced these hormones .
Treatment with progesterone brought about an erection in six out of every ten rats , whilst testosterone brought about the same effect in 30 % , according to the article published in 2004 in the Journal of Neuroendocrinology .
It was yet one more indication that progesterone would perform an important function in erection .
However , the counterproof was lacking .
In a similar study , Monica gave to the animals a compound called mifepristone , which annuls the effect of progesterone .
The animals that received mifepristone did not have an erection , according to the article published this month in Hormones and Behavior .
" Before this study there were no scientific reports concerning the role of progesterone in an erection , " says Elaine Hull , from Florida State University in the United States , a world authority in the neurophysiology of sexual behavior .
In Elaine 's opinion , that fact that the dose of progesterone that showed itself to be effective had been very high - the rats received 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight , a level some 250 times higher to that used in order to leave the rats used to copulation - does not exclude the participation in the erection of another hormone such as corticosterone , associated with stress .
" Even at that , it is an interesting effect , since as yet the action of neither progesterone nor corticosterone have been demonstrated in the control of an erection , " says Elaine Hull .
Before young men resolve to rob the anti-conception power of their girlfriends based on progesterone , one needs to make two points very clear .
Not always do the effects observed in rats happen in human beings .
" These results don 't mean that a normal man will have an erection if he takes progesterone , " says the physiologist Janete Franci , from the University of São Paulo in the city of Ribeirão Preto , who is studying the physiology of reproduction in rats .
Specific studies are necessary in order to prove the role of progesterone in an erection , since the rats evaluated by Monica did not find themselves in a normal physiological state .
" These studies reopen the question of the influence of this hormone in masculine sexual behavior , " says Janete .
" This is one of our main contributions in order to understand the damages caused by the deprivation of sleep , " says Sergio Tufik .
As well , he began to study the consequences of fewer hours of sleep upon the organism some twenty-five years ago , after having obtained an unexpected result in an experiment .
Under the guidance of the psychopharmacologist Elisaldo Carlini , from UNIFESP , Tufik was investigating the effect of drugs such as marijuana upon the central nervous system when he verified that the deprivation of REM sleep brought about a chemical imbalance and made the nerve cells more sensitive to the action of dopamine .
Tufik , Carlini and the pharmacologist Charles Lindsey published in 1978 this resulted in an article in Pharmacology , which turned itself into a reference in this area .
This discovery re-directed Dr. Tufik 's work , a man of almost two meters in stature and of deep voice , who coordinates around sixty researchers in the largest sleep investigation center in Brazil , with an average of twenty five scientific papers published per year .
Obesity and apnea - The investigation into the exaggerated sexual behavior of rats is what mostly catches the attention , but it is a long way from being the only relevance concerning the effects of lack of sleep , which affects almost one third of the population - around 60 million Brazilians .
Other studies with animals and human beings are helping to produce an understanding of how factors apparently unrelated to sleep - such as the chronic pain of arthritis or the emotional attrition of an argument at work - affect the quality of sleep , weaken the performance of memory and make us take a nap the following day .
Research from the UNIFESP team is helping to improve the night rest of those who do not sleep well because of brief interruptions in their breathing - apnea - during their sleep .
Generally , caused by an obstruction of the air passage to the lungs and worsened by obesity , apnea is a problem for between 2 % and 4 % of people older than forty and increases by four times the risk of developing arterial hypertension .
The accumulation of fat , especially around the neck , elevates the risk of the occurrence of breathing failure among men , according to research coordinated by the lung doctor Sônia Togeiro , carried out with one hundred obese patients of both sexes .
Among women , the probability of developing apnea increases according to the increase to the level of their body mass , a number obtained by dividing their weight by the square of their height .
One of the main treatments for obstructive sleep apnea is the use of a mask linked to a piece of apparatus that maintains the flow of air to the lungs known by the acronym CPAP .
A study by the lung doctor Lia Bittencourt has shown that sticking to the CPAP was greater when the user had gone through a guidance program about using the apparatus .
The rheumatologist , Suely Roizenblatt , has recently proven that the relationship between pain and the quality of sleep is a two-way street : pain can well upset sleep , but alterations in sleep also appear to increase sensitivity to pain .
In both cases , the result is always an intense sensation of tiredness during the following day , even if the person has slept for a sufficient number of hours to recharge their energy .
By way of polysomnography - an examination that measures the brain 's electrical activity , heart beat and respiration when a person is asleep - , Suely compared the standard of sleep of seventeen healthy children with that of thirty four with fibromyalgia , a problem of unknown origin that cause pains disseminated by muscles or bones , as well as fatigue .
During the interview with the patients suffering from fibromyalgia , the researcher noted that many mothers complained that they could not sleep well and she decided to include them in her study .
The result : 71 % of the mothers of children with fibromyalgia had also displayed this same problem .
The analysis of the polysomnographs revealed a disturbance in deep sleep , also called the sleep of the slow waves , which precedes REM sleep .
" These subtle alterations do not modify the distribution of the sleep phases , but affect their quality , " explains Suely .
It becomes clearer to understand what she had discovered after a rapid explanation of the structure of sleep , which is characterized by a REM stage and another non-REM stage , with four other phases .
When the eyes begin to get heavy after a long working day , it is a sign that the brain is changing its working rhythm and is beginning to slow down .
In this phase of drowsiness the frequency of the brain 's electrical waves diminishes , consciousness drifts away and the muscles relax .
But any noise still upsets and awakens .
This is phase 1 of sleep , which lasts a few minutes .
In phase 2 , the standard of waves is again altered and the electroencephalogram registers rapid electrical discharges , of less than a second in duration .
The body has already become relaxed and it is more difficult to awake .
These two initial phases are given the name of light sleep or sleep of rapid waves and lasts around forty five minutes , half of a complete sleep cycle .
A long way from heavy medicines
A watershed in the clinical research carried out at the Sleep Institute of UNIFESP has been contributing to an improvement in the quality of life of people who every night need to count flocks of sheep before going off to sleep .
In a study that demanded a certain amount of audacity , the neurologist Dalva Poyares showed that it is possible to leave to one side the medicines used to induce sleep .
She proposed to a group of twenty-five ( 25 ) patients with chronic insomnia that they abandon all of a sudden the benzodiazepines that they had been taking for at least two years .
It is estimated that one in four insomniacs take this medicine that doctors avoid prescribing as it generates dependency .
After some days the ex-users of benzodiazepines managed to fall asleep without taking anything .
To be fair , on the first day without the medicine the insomnia got worse and the volunteers suffered even more before sleeping .
But after three days of lack of sleep and of the nervousness caused by the withdrawal symptoms from the medicine , they diminished and the patients managed to sleep better .
The polysomnographs revealed that , two weeks after abandoning the medicine , the quality of the sleep of these individuals was already better than when they had been taking the medicine .
The reason is that benzodiazepines diminishes the duration of the sleep phases 3 and 4 , those that are most energy restoring , in accordance with the study 's results published during 2004 in the Journal of Psychiatric Research .
" The effects of insomnia are not as serious as those brought on by the chronic use of benzodiazepines , " says Dalva .
As insomnia comes back after two weeks without the medication , the way out is to look for alternatives that are more appropriate for prolonged usage , whose indication varies from case to case .
Alpha effect - As the sleep deepens in phases 3 and 4 , the brain waves get progressively slower .
The breathing rhythm falls , the heart beat rate declines and noises no longer upset the rhythm .
" This is when it becomes more difficult to waken up , " explains the English biologist Paul Martin in Counting Sheep : the Science and Pleasures of Sleep and Dreams .
It is within these phases , considered to be the most compensating of all of the sleep cycle , that these tenuous alterations known as the alpha pattern come about .
There is as well an association between the occurrence of the alpha pattern and the increase of intensity of pain after sleep , as another study showed , carried out with forty women with fibromyalgia and forty-three without the problem .
In Suely 's opinion , this interference called alpha pattern can prejudice the production of serotonin .
Generally produced during the 3rd and 4th phases of sleep , serotonin acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system , but produces an analgesic effect in the peripheral nerves .
" This alteration of sleep appears to reduce the resistance to pain , " the researcher comments .
As a consequence , any kind of pain - stubbing one 's toe on the end of a table , for example - is always felt with more intensity .
The use of ultrasound in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed itself to be efficient in reducing the pain , but did not eliminate the interferences in the sleep of the slow waves of these patients , according to a study done by Suely and Tatiana Almeida published during 2003 in the magazine Pain .
A comparison of the sleep of twenty ( 20 ) healthy children and adolescents between the ages of ten and sixteen with that of twenty one ( 21 ) young people of the same age group suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , an inflammation that makes the joints rigid and painful , suggests the opposite to that observed with fibromyalgia .
Dr. Suely did not find any interference in the sleep of the fast waves not with the slow waves , but the polysonography pointed to 12 % of the children and adolescents with arthritis awakening during the night after having fallen asleep , which normally occurs with 2 % of those without inflammation of the joints .
The sleep of the young with arthritis was also of inferior quality , with more awakenings or interruptions in the different phases of sleep .
They woke up around twelve times per hour of deep sleep and twenty four times during light sleep and REM sleep , whereas these awakenings were no more than three per hour of sleep for those without a problem in their joints .
The result of this awake-sleep-awake-sleep is that the person gets up with the same feeling of tiredness that was there before sleeping .
Another team from the Sleep Laboratory , headed by the biomedical doctor , Deborah Suchecki , is beginning to uncover how weariness from a tumultuous day robs the possibility of a good night 's rest .
One of the first analyses has shown the awakening affects causes by acute psychological stress , as would be brought on with the discovery of an unexpected debt in a bank account .
Deborah submitted rats to different forms of stress with the objective of investigating if they were to produce distinct alterations in sleep .
In order to induce the animals into this state , she left a group of rats immobilized for an hour before the time at which they would normally sleep and afterwards registered the standard of sleep .
Instead of falling into sleep , the rodents found themselves to be alert and practically none of them slept during the first hours after stress .
After , compensating the lost hours during daylight , the rats extended their sleep for almost three hours .
This result helped to understand why people remained sleepless the day following that in which they had confronted a stressful situation , such as being assaulted in the street .
Deborah obtained similar results when she submitted the laboratory animals to physical stress , exposing them to a cold temperature of 4 ° C for an hour .
The explanation : during stress the organism responds with a faster liberation of corticoids , hormones that accelerate the production of energy and help to maintain the body alert .
But the corticoids become harmful when they remain at high levels for a long time .
There are indications that the damage done through lack of sleep really goes beyond tiredness that does not go away and the difficulty of concentration during the day after .
A bad night 's rest echoes through all of the body .
As well there are signs that , with fewer hours between the sheets , the cardiac muscle brings about alternative forms of obtaining energy in response to this extra attrition .
" Has some friend of yours nodded off while at the wheel ? , " and the number of affirmative replies jumped to 52 % .
During 2000 , the bus company from the state of Minais Gerais , Nacional Expresso sent two hundred and thirty ( 230 ) drivers for a polysomnograph test .
The result : 55 % of them felt sleepiness at the same hour during which they should have been driving .
Mello proposed a work timetable that followed the biological rhythm of the drivers , who today alternate their shifts only once per month and no longer after every thirty-six ( 36 ) hours .
The number of monthly accidents fell by 40 % and the costs due to minor accidents went down from R $ 150,000.00 to R $ 30,000.00 .
Last year it was the turn of Reunidas Paulista , from the town of Araçatuba , in the interior of Sao Paulo State , to evaluate their four hundred ( 400 ) motorists .
Rescheduling the scale of the shifts , the number of fatal victims on one of the company 's routes fell from 3.6 to 0.6 for every 100,000 kilometers driven .
There was as well a reduction of up to 30 % in the accidents during the critical hours - between three and five o ' clock in the morning and between one and three o ' clock in the afternoon .
The effect of this research could even be much wider as the National Transit Board is studying the possibility of making the evaluation of professional motorists sleep by way of polysomnographs obligatory with each renewal of their driving license .

Molecular Signature
Method uses a small fragment of DNA to identify animal species
Marcos Pivetta
In the supermarket there is not a single product without a barcode , a form of identification composed in truth of a combination of eleven digits .
But every kind of good a specific numerical sequence , unique and distinct from that found with all of the others .
Two types of articles , even though they are very alike , display different series of algorithms .
The system recognizes accurately and rapidly , any genre of the item present in the store .
In nature there is no animal that does not have the cytochrome gene named C-oxidase I ( COI ) , one of the ones most studied through genetics and located in the genome of the mitochondria , the cell 's energy unit .
But , according to some biologists , each species has a small fragment of COI that is characteristic , particular and diverse from that found in all of the others .
Two varieties of an organism , although they may be extremely similar , exhibit , in this gene , distinct sequences of nucleotides , the chemical unit that makes up the DNA .
Such a piece of COI , of around six hundred and fifty ( 650 ) nucleotides say these researchers , contains the molecular signature of each species and can serve as the base for the creation of a barcode of life : a rapid system , precise and ( relatively ) cheap of identifying species on a large scale , above all of animals .
The idea of implementing genetic taxonomy was proposed around two years ago by the biologist Paul Hebert , from the University of Guelph , in Canada .
Since then the new form of characterization and of cataloguing organisms has gained followers within the scientific community .
In February , the Natural History Museum of London served as the location for the first international conference sponsored by the Consortium for the Barcode of Life ( CBOL ) , founded last year to spread the methodology .
Close to two hundred ( 200 ) researchers from museums , zoos , herbaria , universities and research institutes from the five continents , including representatives from Brazil , participated in the event .
The meeting served to gear up two international projects of weight for the next five years : the initiative that is going to determine the genetic signature of the 10,000 known species of birds and plants and the effort that is aimed at determining the life bar code of 23,000 species of fish , 15,000 from the sea and 8,000 coming from fresh waters .
There are as well local initiatives , such as the project for the genetic characterization of species of trees in Costa Rica .
" We estimate that it will cost around US $ 1 billion to implement a digital library with the barcode of the 10 million animal species that must exist , of which today we know only 10 % , " says Hebert .
" It would be premature to calculate the costs of mounting a similar system with the data of organisms of other kingdoms . "
Although it is part of the Consortium of the Barcode of Life ( CBOL ) , Brazil as yet is not formally involved in any large scale project that makes use of molecular taxonomy .
" We have only initial points , such as studies that we can carry out in our own laboratory with bats and Brazilian birds , " commented the geneticist Fabrício Santos , from the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , which is integrated into the consortium and had been present at the conference in London .
" But we need a national network , as occurred in the Genome Projects , which stimulates the participation of various institutions in a wider range of work about certain groups of animals , plants and microorganisms . "
Birds and butterflies -- The geneticist Ana Maria de Lima Azeredo Espin , the director of the Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering Center of the State University of Campinas ( CBMEG / Unicamp ) , who also participated in the meeting in England , is equally favorable to the formulation of initiatives in the area of molecular taxonomy .
" We are thinking about proposing a project that uses the barcodes of DNA , perhaps within FAPESP 's Biota Program , " says Ana Maria , who makes use of the technique in genetic-evolution studies with species of flies .
The new methodology is showing itself to be useful on two major fronts : to generate a molecular signature for animals already identified by science and to discover new species that have not up until now been detailed out by traditional taxonomy .
In a study published last October in the scientific magazine PLoS Biology , Dr. Hebert and his Canadian colleagues , along with North American researchers showed that the sequencing of only six hundred and forty eight ( 648 ) nucleotides of the COI gene were sufficient to correctly discriminate the two hundred and sixty ( 260 ) known species of North American birds .
Each animal has a barcode in its own mitochondrial DNA , different from the sequence present in the others .
The distinctions in the analyzed region of the COI gene were eighteen ( 18 ) greater among birds of two close species than between two examples of the same species .
Evidence that only with the genetic information , without recurring to anatomic and environmental data , is it possible to discriminate all species .
Also during October , in an article published in the American magazine Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Hebert and Daniel Janzen , from Pennsylvania State University in the United States , presented ten new species of tropical butterflies , all of them derived from the Astraptes fulgerator .
In this case the scientists made use of information generated by the DNA barcode technique in order to confirm an ancient suspicion developed through years of field studies with this butterfly in Costa Rica : that the A. fulgerator was not the only species , but in reality a complex of at least tem occult species .
Although they generated practically identical adult butterflies , each species exhibited colors and physical traits different in their larvae form and fed themselves from distinctly different plants -- as well , clearly , of presenting a particular sequence in the COI gene .
Some biologists , accustomed to classifying organisms by way of the comparison of anatomical traits and of the study of their habitats , have turned up their noses towards the molecular signature approach .
And they question : how can a piece of a single gene identify all of the animals ?
In spite of criticism , the new technique did not spring up to combat conventional taxonomy .
On the contrary .
I would be used as a tool in order to give dynamism to the work of the species professionals .
" The barcode is not going to substitute classical taxonomy , " explained Dr. Santos .
" It 's only the incorporation of more taxonomic information , only in the form of DNA characters . "
Like every technique , it has its limitations .
The COI gene , for example , may not be the best to identify certain animals .
In the case of plants , there is almost a consensus of opinion that the chloroplast gene , and organelle involved in photosynthesis , should be chosen as the molecular signature of vegetables .
The Beauty and the beast
A study reveals orchids from Central Brazil and describes the damage caused by viruses and insects
Alessandra Pereira
Among the 16,000 orchids grown at the Botanic Institute of Sao Paulo , united within long covered corridors of plants , stacked up to the roof , there has been lost for around twenty years the chuva-de-ouro ( golden rain ) , thus named in virtue of its small yellow flowers that fall from its offshoots lie a waterfall .
This species , the Oncidium flexuosum , is relatively common in Brazil but has the value of a rare jewel for the botanist Fábio de Barros : it was indeed an example of a chuva-de-ouro that aroused in him a passion for orchids some thirty-two years ago .
At that time , as a sixteen year old , Barros did what today would be disapproved of : he pulled off a plant from a tree in a country estate in Juquitiba , in the southeast of the state of Sao Paulo , and took it home to the city of Sao Paulo .
It was his mother , Antonieta , who explained to him that he was dealing with an orchid .
" This is one of the best memories that I have of my mother , " he says .
Nia , as she was known , died a few months after this incident and did not have time to see her son turn himself into one of the principal authorities on orchids in the country .
Barros became so respected that his name has been given by his colleagues to an orchid with purple flowers , called Pleurothallis fabiobarrosii , which lives in the stony soil of a group of mountains in the north of Minas Gerais State known as the Espinhaço ridge .
It also grows in the rustic countryside of the same state , brimming with herbs and shrubs with many colored flowers , a variety of orchid recently described by him : the Grobya cipoensis , which perfumes and decorates the highest stretches of the Cipó ridge , in the central region of Minas Gerais , with its sweet aroma of honey and tiny yellow flowers speckled with brown .
In this same piece of work , Barros and the botanic illustrator Ricardo de Azevedo Lourenço described other species of the same genre , the Grobya guieselli , whose yellow flowers resemble a bird .
Found only in stretches of the Atlantic Rainforest in the state of Santa Catarina , the G .
guieselli can grow up to three times larger than the species from the Cipó ridge and can attain a height of 61 centimeters .
Other Barros discoveries appear in the book Orquidologia sul-americana : uma compilação científica [ South American Orchidology : a scientific compilation ] , coordinated by him and Gilberto Kerbauy , another specialist in these plants , who works at the Biosciences Institute of the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) .
Published by the Secretary of the Environment for the State of Sao Paulo , the work brings together studies of pure scientific stamp and others essentially practical , signed for by twenty Brazilian and one Argentinean researchers-- enriched , clearly , with photographs and dazzling illustrations .
A study by Barros himself concerning the distribution of orchid species in the plateaus and ridges s of Central Brazil merits highlighting .
On analyzing the hills of the states of Minas , Goiás and Bahia , the Paulista botanist verified the surprising diversity of orchids of this region .
It had been believed that this area in the heartland of the country was poor in species of this group of plants since it was occupied by the Cerrado , a type of vegetation that is normally dry , with stunted and sparse trees , subject to frequent natural fires .
The flowers of the rustic countryside -- By comparing the vegetation of the Cipó ridge , in Minas Gerais , with that of Cardoso Island , a left-over of the Atlantic Rainforest off the southern coast of the State of Sao Paulo , Barros knocked flat this erroneous idea .
In fact the Cerrado as a whole really shows low diversity of orchids in the face of the exuberance in the Atlantic Rainforest or the Amazon basin .
But two specific environments of the Cerrado -- the rustic countryside , which occupy the highest stretches of the Cerrado , above 1,000 meters in altitude , and the riverside ciliates , which thrive on the edges of rivers -- house dozens of different species .
Therein live examples as distinct as the Habenaria magniscutata , an earthy species with roots and fine leaves , and the Bulbophyllum weddellii , with roots and fleshy like leaves -- both excluded from the rustic countryside .
Finally , the diversity of the orchids of the Cerrado region shows itself to be only a little inferior to that observed on Cardoso Island , a protected area of the coastal forest that makes up the orchids ' paradise : only there , in an area close to 150 km2 , one hundred and one ( 101 ) species have already been identified .
This total represents close to 3 % of the 3,000 orchid species existing in the forests and in the countryside of Brazil , a country rich in exclusive species : close to 1,700 only exist here .
In the whole world there are some 20,000 natural species and a further 30,000 hybrids , generated by crossing different species in the laboratory .
How can one explain this unexpected richness of Central Brazil ?
Part of the answer appears not to be there , but to be in the two neighboring ecosystems : the Amazon Rainforest in the north and northeast and the Atlantic Rainforest in the east .
" These two major masses of forest preserve a wide variety of species of orchids that can also be found in the riverbank vegetation of Central Brazil , " explains Barros .
To a certain extent , the riverside vegetations of the Cerrado connect this environment with their more humid neighbors , the Amazon and the Atlantic Rainforest , allowing for an exchange of species .
A lot more difficult is to explain what makes these plants so fascinating .
The reasons couldl be as varied as the very orchids themselves .
There are species of 2 millimeters , others of 4 meters in height ; their flowers can be absolutely white or as colored as the canvases of surrealist artists ; some species generate a single flower , whilst others exhibit more than one hundred of them at a single time .
Their strategies for survival are also notable : these plants adapt themselves to practically any environment -- the majority are epiphyte , or that is to say , grow upon trees -- and they can go for months without rain because they are capable of storing water and nutrients in their leaves , in their roots and in the stock .
The smell of rotting meat -- But what is even more enchanting with these plants are the various reproduction mechanisms .
At a certain point , the English naturalist Charles Darwin , the creator of the evolution theory of species through natural selection , wrote that the adaptations linked to the pollination of orchids transcribed even what the human imagination could create .
Examples of some species of Ophris imitate the sexual partner of the pollinating insects , which , seduced by the smell , color and form , attempt to copulate with the flowers -- clearly it does not work out but they leave there with pollen that they carry to another orchid flower .
Others attract the insects by way of the form of their flowers , whilst others , such as the genres Pleurothallis and Bulbophyllum , would make anyone turn up their nose with a smell of rotting meat , but it is exactly this smell , liberated by its purplish flowers , that attract the flies -- and it is they who carry the pollen to another example of the same species and thus guarantee the plant 's fertilization .
Virus and wasps -- In another chapter of the book , Lo Siok Tien , Silvia Galleti and Cesar Chagas , from the Botanical Institute of Sao Paulo , show how they deal with the main viruses that infest these plants .
Of the twenty-seven ( 27 ) already identified , there are three that are more aggressive : the virus of cymbidium mosaic virus disease of Cymbidium , the necrotic rings / flecks of Odontoglossum and Rhabdovirus .
The first named virus affects 11 % of the orchids in the state of Sao Paulo and tinges its leaves with yellowish markings .
The virus Odontoglossum brings about rings on the dead tissue , whilst that of Rhabdovirus speckles the leaves with reddish-brown points .
Principally transmitted by the use of contaminated scissors or pots , these viruses are only contained by means of the disinfecting of the material for potting and planting or more radical measures such as the elimination of the sick or suspect plants that have been infected .
Viruses are not the only natural enemies of orchids .
A small black wasp , the Calorileya nigra , deposits its eggs in the roots of some species of the genre of Cattleya , which , as a consequence , grow ugly and deformed .
There are also other chapters with interesting studies on orchid producers , whose sales have an annual gross income of around R $ 400,000.00 on the internal market , whilst exports of orchid offshoots generates an annual income of around US $ 100,000.00 .
It makes up a small portion of the flower market in Brazil , estimated , in this same book , at R $ 2 billion , but this business still has room for growth .
" There is immense potential to be explored , " emphasizes Barros .
" Brazil has a vast territory , a climate suitable for the cultivation of tropical plants and an elevated variety of species that could be grown commercially . "
The Brazilian flora in fact houses a vast variety of orchids , many of them as yet undiscovered and others probably already extinct -- only in the State of Sao Paulo there are around one hundred and forty ( 140 ) species that run the risk of disappearing .
In Brazil two of the most threatened orchids are the Cattleya schilleriana and the Cattleya velutina , widely collected as they produce large and eye-catching flowers -- both practically no longer exist in their natural environment , the Atlantic Rainforest , and are maintained only in greenhouses .
But there are ways of redeeming the loses : groups of orchid lovers are reproducing rare native species in the laboratory and even re-introducing these plants into their natural environment .
This is a symbolic form of devolving back to nature what man has removed .

The hot and the cold that comes from magnets
A Unicamp team discovers unexpected properties of magnetic materials
Carlos Fioravanti
New scientific concepts are changing the way home appliances goods work .
First it was the television , whose image is no longer generated by the collision of highly accelerated electrons using a fluorescent screen .
Equipment with liquid crystal or plasma screens , by way of electric currents or gases that originate the luminous signals , offer images that have more definition , even though they are at a price equivalent to that of a car -- from R $ 20,000.00 to R $ 80,000.00 .
The next piece of equipment to pass through a similar metamorphosis could be the refrigerator : the next generation will not work with gas expansion and contraction , which removes the heat from the air on circulating through the tubes of the refrigerator walls , but by way of the action of magnetic fields , which should perform the same task with greater efficiency and less energy loss .
In the prototypes of magnetic refrigerators -- already under development in some countries such as the United States , Japan and France -- the material used to reduce the temperature is gadolinium , a metal chosen for its malleability and showing an acceptable efficiency at the temperature of the environment .
But it is almost certain that gadolinium will be only provisional : for the new refrigerators materials are being sought that are capable of being cooled or heated with a greater efficiency when submitted to a magnetic field .
Recent discoveries carried out in Campinas show that there could in fact be alternatives with a better refrigerating capacity .
Physicists from the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and from the State University of Rio de Janeiro ( Uerj ) have verified that a compound formed between manganese and arsenic , under high pressure , demonstrates the capacity of retaining heat at an environment twenty ( 20 ) times greater than that of gadolinium at normal pressure , one atmosphere , the same as that at which we live on the surface of the planet .
This is a relevant scientific finding , even though at the present moment it is far away from any application .
The high pressure to which this compound of manganese and arsenic -- the Mn-As -- has to be submitted in order to exhibit this result is only one of the limitations that impede this property from being immediately useful in the prototypes of magnetic refrigerators .
But something new could quickly come from this in practical terms because this so intense capacity of absorbing heat -- baptized by the physicists of Unicamp as the colossal magnetocaloric effect -- had not previously been observed in any other material .
" This discovery opens up a research field of other compounds that show the colossal effect and manage to extract a lot more energy from the region to be cooled , without the limitations of manganese-arsenic , " comments the physicist Sérgio Gama , a researcher from Unicamp and the coordinator of this study , when writing in the edition of the 3rd of December for the magazine Physical Review Letters .
In this article , Gama also proposed an explanation for the colossal effect .
As he and his team had experimentally verified , the manganese-arsenic compound cools by way of three associated effects ( see illustration ) .
The first is the most common mechanism of materials of this type : the un-aligning of the spins of the electrons .
Spin is a magnetic property of elementary atomic particles , with both direction and sense , just like the earth 's magnetic field .
The direction of spin of a particle can be affected by an external magnetic field or by the spins of neighboring particles : when the spins align in the same sense , the temperature of any body increases -- this is the principle through which it is intended to arrive at a refrigeration that is more efficient .
The second mechanism that explains the colossal effect is the transformation of the atomic structure itself -- the crystalline network -- of the Mn-As .
Finally , the third and most important artifice of Mn-As to absorb energy results from the interaction of the crystalline network with the magnetic field , expressed by way of the deformation of the material .
Up until now , the magnetocaloric effect -- the capacity of a magnetic material to absorb or liberate heat when submitted to the influence of a magnetic field -- was essentially explained by way of the alignment or un-alignment of the spins , without the changes in the network of atoms having been seen as very important .
When submitted to the effect of a magnetic field , within a thermally isolated environment , the spins of the electrons align themselves in a single sense , thus abdicating themselves from the habitual pandemonium in which they live .
This ordering means a decrease in entropy -- or disorder -- of a physical system .
As there is no exchange of heat with the environment , the total entropy must remain constant : consequently , the atoms or molecules of the material submitted to the influence of the magnetic field become more disorganized in such a way as to compensate for the spin alignment .
Greater disorder means greater atomic movement -- and the temperature of the material increases .
It is by way of the alignment of spins that a piece of gadolinium warms up by 4 ° C when placed in a thermally isolated environment , to which is applied a magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla , close to 30,000 times greater than the earth 's magnetic field .
As the effect is reversible , when the magnetic field is removed , the gadolinium cools the same 4 ° C .
Does it appear too small to keep beer cold ?
It so happens that the construction of magnetic refrigerators forecasts the use of special heat exchangers , called regenerators , which widen this variation of temperature .
In order to turn itself commercially viable , the magnetic refrigerator also depends on new geometric arrangements of permanent magnets -- like those already used in the hard disk reader of a computer or in the motors that move the windscreen wipers of cars -- so that they form intense magnetic fields and are of low cost .
With gadolinium the capacity to absorb or to give off heat is of purely magnetic origin : the result principally of the alignment of spins .
It is in this way as well that other materials that show the classical magnetocaloric effect , the most tenuous of this category , happen .
And as well the basic mechanism through which the materials that present the other known effect up until now work , the effect called the gigantic magnetocaloric effect , evidently more intense than the classic , but inferior to the colossal .
Some alloys that exhibit the gigantic effect -- such as the so called 5 : 2 : 2 , formed by five atoms of gadolinium , two of germanium and two of silicon -- can also count upon another artifice : they absorb a high amount of energy , the so called latent heat , whilst their temperature remains constant .
It is the same phenomenon that can be verified with a block of melting ice : the ice absorbs heat , which is used in its transformation into the liquid phase ; its temperature remains steady on reaching 0 ° C and only goes up again when all of the ice has melted .
Deformation -- Gama experimentally demonstrated that , in the case of manganese-arsenic , as well as the alignment of the spins of the electrons and of latent heat , the very atomic structure of the material itself , that the physicists call its crystalline structure , contribute in a decisive manner to explaining this notable capacity of extracting heat from the surroundings : when submitted to pressure and to a magnetic field , the manganese-arsenic also deforms , bringing about the colossal effect , which is seven times greater that the gigantic effect .
Other materials also show this property , called the magnetoelectric effect , which normally causes its deformation .
However , the Mn-As is notable : it contracts by 3 % .
" This is an absurdly high value , " says Gama , " since the deformation of other materials is dozens or hundreds of times less . "
Although endowed with these properties , the manganese-arsenic is not a convenient material for applications because one of its characteristics generates an insuperable problem : even at room pressure , it does not return to the point of origin when submitted to a cycle of warming and cooling .
When the temperature increases , the spins get out of line and its atomic arrangement modifies when reaching 43 ° C -- this is the point in which the so called magnetic and structural transition occurs .
But the Mn-As only comes back to its initial state , with the spins aligned and with a hexagonal structure , at a temperature that is much lower , that of 35 ° C .
it is as if water were to become vapor at 100 ° C and when cooled only returns to the liquid state at 80 ° C .
If the Mn-As were to be used in a refrigerator , extra energy would be necessary to make the cycle of refrigeration close and for another cycle to begin -- something extremely inefficient .
" The refrigeration cycles need to start and finish at the same temperature or with minimal variations , so as to reduce the losses in efficiency , " comments Gama .
As a further complication , when the Mn-As is submitted to high pressure , this temperature difference increases even more : reaching 32 ° C .
In search of alternatives , the Unicamp group discovered , in studies with other groups , that the temperature difference between the start and finish of the cycle , the so-called hysteresis , gets close to zero at room temperature when a small part ( 5 % ) of the arsenic is substituted by antimony .
" Compounds with a higher quantity of antimony appear to be promising , " stated the Unicamp group coordinator , " although hysteresis , lagging , is still observed under pressure .. "
Brazilian cell -- Gama has been working with magnetocaloric materials since 2000 , but began to study the behavior of materials under pressure whenever he and his group heard about the phenomenon at a congress on magnetism that took place in July of 2003 in Rome , the Italian capital city .
It was there that they came in contract with a device the size of a pen -- a pressure cell -- , produced , as they found out afterwards , by a guy from Rio de Janeiro who had founded a company in Cambridge , in England .
As the price was high -- around US $ 20,0000.00 -- , the physicists from Unicamp decided to build a similar cell in Brazil .
Each one of them cost less than R $ 3,000.00 in material .
The Brazilian cell , which had been ready some two months after the Italian congress , is a copper-beryllium cylinder of 10 centimeters ( 10 cm ) in length and eight millimeters ( 8 mm ) in diameter , with two pistons locked in by two screws .
Using this apparatus , Gama 's team could then measure the magnetocaloric effect under pressure , which at that time had not yet been described .
The first material to be measured under pressure was in fact manganese- arsenic , already studied by the Unicamp physicists as having presented gigantic effects : the magnetocaloric and magnetoelastic effects .
Gama was not the first to report the magnetocaloric effect under pressure because a Spanish group from the University of Zaragoza , together with another group from Prague , the Czech Republic , published before them , also in the magazine Physical Review Letters , the results that they had arrived at with a compound formed from terbium , germanium and silicon .
However , this involved only the gigantic effect and not the colossal effect .

Topography maps of Brazil
Images captured by Endeavour and produced by Embrapa show Brazilian topography
Marcos de Oliveira
Maps of Brazil with images captured in space are going to show , in an unprecedented manner , the relief of all of the country .
Mountains , erosions , inclines and all types of elevations or slopes of the ground are now more defined , precise and better visualized in the group of images of the Brazilian topography that the Satellite Monitoring Unit of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ( Embrapa ) is preparing and going to make available starting from the month of April on the institution 's website .
The maps are the result of methodology developed by Embrapa based on the data obtained by the space shuttle Endeavour during a mission carried out in February of 2000 .
The mission entitled Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ( SRTM ) , generated enormous data ( 12 terabytes ) and covered some 80 % of the surface of the planet earth where 95 % of the world 's population lives .
The space mission was an operation projected and financed the North American Space Agency ( NASA ) , the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) and the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) .
With the raw and free data in hand , the Embrapa team from the city of Campinas , coordinated by Evaristo Eduardo de Miranda , started working in 2002 , when NASA released the files of South America still in the form of numbers or images that would not have reminded one of colored and easy to understand maps .
Finalized , the images went through a series of useful applications , principally in the area of territorial planning and of environmental mounting .
" Within the applications are the sustainable development of agriculture ; programs for the management of river basins ; the preservation of forestry resources ; ecological and economic zoning ; studies on conservation of soils in order to identify and avoid erosion and even the implanting of rural electrification and highways , " Miranda says .
" By analyzing the maps , we can verify , depending on the direction , the declines and inclines of a highway , as well as its altitude , which could facilitate the planning of journeys and the transport of heavy cargoes , for example . "
The SRTM maps could also contribute to the improvement of the existing altimetry cartography , principally in the isolated areas of the Amazon .
The altitude data is also going to benefit telecommunications .
In the maps generated by Embrapa for the municipality of Sao Paulo , for example , the Paulista spine ( the elevated land where Paulista Avenue is located ) is perfectly visible , as well as the beds and the and confluences of the rivers Tamanduateí , Tietê and Pinheiros , as well as the Colônia crater , in the district of Parelheiros , probably formed by a meteorite .
" We hope the American government releases the original resolution captured by Endeavour , of 30 meters by 30 meters , " Miranda says .
The White House decided to restrict the resolution of the images after the attacks of September 11th of 2001 .
" We believe that , shortly , they are going to liberate the 30 x 30 meters images , as they are already doing so for some research programs . "
Even with these restrictions , the SRTM images still produce a sophisticated product that brings advances in obtaining topographic data and also in the use of radar for this type of work .
" Only to get an idea of the dimension of sophistication of the SRTM we can compare it with the Radam ( Radar for Amazonia ) Project that produced images ( and not topography ) by way of the radar in aircraft , principally in the Amazonian region in the decade of the 70s .
If we were to group together all of the flying hours , they spent almost three years of make the images of all of Brazil with various space discontinuities , whilst the Endeavour carried out in eleven days the homogenous measurement of almost all of the planet . "
In order to complete the eleven day mission , between the 11th and the 22nd of February 2000 , Endeavour orbited the earth sixteen ( 16 ) times per day , completing 176 orbits , at a velocity of 7.5 kilometers per second ( 7.5 km / s ) .
The new images made by Endeavour were also formed from two sources , in this case two antennae .
The ship made use of the interpherometric system in which two radars emit signals on bands X and C , two electromagnetic waves that rebound off the earth 's ground and return to the space shuttle where they are captured by two groups of antennae , including an external one , fastened by a 60 meter mast .
The result is two captured images of literally different positions .
By comparing these differences of the reflected signals , an image of the relief is formed .
The use of radar for this type of application is more interesting than using optical cameras in planes and satellites because it is possible to operate during day and night , and without the interference of cloud .
The optical images can only be done with solar light and a clear sky .
The first piece of work carried out by the researchers at Embrapa 's Monitoring Satellite Unit with the new images came at the request of the Ministry of Defense with the objective of supplying the Brazilian army unit that would go off to Haiti in command of the UNO Peacekeeping Force .
" We collected the information from NASA and we mounted maps of the territory in 3-dimensions ( 3D ) , making use of SRTM images upon which were superimposed images from various satellites , " Miranda says .
Thus , by way of specific software , it is possible to make a journey through the images as if we were in a helicopter flying over a city or region .
This same technique was used for demonstrating the relief of the Paraíba Valley , the Greater Sao Paulo Region and part of the coast .
Agricultural model - In order to demonstrate the scope of potential of the images , and topographical maps via the SRTM , Embrapa researchers have generated a map of the average temperatures of the State of Sao Paulo , starting from the existing relationships between them and the altitude levels .
" This type of map is important for zoning within the agricultural industry , because it provides data for a more precise analysis of the appropriateness or not of determined agricultural crops in the various regions of the state . "
The image preparation demanded of the Embrapa Monitoring Satellite Unit a tremendous technical effort during the data processing .
" We 'd never used such computers .
If it hadn 't been for our equipment infrastructure , we would 've taken a lot longer to prepare the images , " Miranda underlines .
" After we had downloaded the data , we began to understand it , in order to organize the projection systems for Brazil . "
One of the problems presented by this technology is the non-differentiation of beds of water such as rivers and lakes .
" In order to see them , one needs to carry out corrections with the help of other images and maps , principally those of satellites . "
For 3-dimensional visualizing , the researchers generated an artificial shadowing of the relief , simulating the sun in the afternoon period , positioned to the north of the area and projecting its rays at an angle of 45 degrees .
The image thus obtained is easily projected and the maps are easy to understand .
The first state to have its relief map ready , having come from the SRTM data , was Sergipe , because of its small territorial dimension .
The work done during it permitted greater facility in the production of the other Brazilian states .
All of the maps and numerical images are compatible on a scale of 1 : 250.000 , in which every millimeter is equivalent to 250 meters on the ground .
The SRTM images and numerical data will be on show at the website of Embrapa 's Monitoring Satellite Unit ( www.cnpm.embrapa.br ) and in the future on a set of CDs .
They will be incorporated into the collection Brazil Seen From Space , launched during 2001 by Embrapa , based on data from the Landsat satellite , and which shows the environmental characteristics of the national territory such as forests , semi-arid areas , agricultural areas without a determination of the relief .
Embrapa is going to present the two images ( SRTM and Landsat ) side by side , on the website and on CDs , on maps sub-divided by the states of the federation .

Valuable poisons
Studies with poisonous animals have resulted in the licensing of seven patents , candidates for medicines
Dinorah Ereno
Synthesized starting from the venom of the pit viper , of the rattle snake , of the bristles of the hairy caterpillar and of the saliva of the cayenne tick , molecules developed by the Applied Toxicology Center ( CAT ) , with its headquarters at the Butantan Institute , have already resulted in seven ( 7 ) licensed patents for Consórcio Farmacêutico ( Coinfar ) , a consortium formed between the laboratories Biolab-Sanus , União Química and Biosintética .
Three of these patents are directed towards anti-hypertension , the so-called evasins , acronym in English for : endogenous vasopeptidase inhibitor , obtained from the venom of the pit viper ( Bothrops jararaca ) .
These anti-hypertension drugs have been in the pre-clinical trial stage for more than two years at the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) .
" It is probable that during this year we will go into clinical trials , " says professor Antonio Carlos Martins de Camargo , the head of the CAT , one of the ten Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers ( Cepid ) financed by FAPESP .
Two other patents refer to the protein named lopap , removed from the bristles that cover the body of the caterpillar Lonomia obliqua , which has shown itself to have the potential of transforming itself into a medicine for the treatment of thrombosis .
The first lopap patent deals with obtaining and describing the protein starting from the bristles , and its indicated use in the prevention of thrombosis .
And the second is with respect to obtaining and the use of the recombinant protein produced starting from genetically modified bacteria .
The last two licensed patents , deal with , respectively , a protein of analgesic potential called enpak ( endogenous pain killer ) , obtained from the venom of the rattlesnake ( Crotalus terrificus ) ( see Pesquisa FAPESP Nº 100 ) , and of a protein with a coagulation inhibitor factor , extracted from the saliva of the cayenne tick , Amblyomma cajennense , named amblyomin-X .
In a single dose , the enpak has shown itself to have an analgesic power that is six hundred ( 600 ) times greater than that of morphine .
The amblyomin-X shows itself to be active on various cultures of tumor cells , however , without damaging the normal cells , as was related by Dr. Ana Marisa Chudzinski-Tavassi , from the Biochemical and Biophysics Laboratory of the Butantan Institute , the coordinator for the research with lopap and amblyomin-X .
" Mice with melanoma have had complete remission of their tumors and one year later they 're still alive and healthy , " Ana Marisa explains .
These expenses have been financed from the monies passed by the Coinfar , corresponding to 10 % of the investment put up by the Foundation .
Starting from the signing of the patent licensing contract , the consortium is responsible for the development costs of the products .
If they were to go onto the pharmacy shelves , each one of the trio , the Butantan Institute , FAPESP and the Coinfar Consortium , would receive one third of the royalties from sales , " professor Camargo advised .

From nature to the drugstore
An anti-inflammatory made from the extract of a plant from the Atlantic Rainforest , is ready to go on the market
Dinorah Ereno
A plant native to the Atlantic Rainforest , known locally as erva-baleeira or maria-milagrosa , forms the basis of an anti-inflammatory that had already received clearance from the National Agency for Sanitary Vigilance ( Anvisa ) and is scheduled to arrive in the pharmacies during this semester .
" This will be the first anti-inflammatory remedy made from the extract of a Brazilian plant , the Cordia verbenacea , " says José Roberto Lazzarini , the medicine and research and development director of Aché , the company that is going to launch the product in the form of a cream with the commercial name of Acheflan .
" Medicinal plant anti-inflammatory products exist , but they come from other origins such as Africa and other countries . "
Patented in Brazil and abroad , the new product belongs to the class of phyto-medications , medicines that have within their composition only the active ingredient extracted from plants .
By the Anvisa regulations , they can never be mixed with the main synthetic active ingredients , vitamins or minerals .
And the same rules applied for the production of medicines must be followed for those of phyto-medications , such as proof of their efficiency and safety .
" In clinical tests , Acheflan proved to be efficient and safe for cases of chronic tendinitis and myofascial pain when compared with the main anti-inflammatory on the market , which has as its main active ingredient the diclofenac potassium , " says Reynaldo Jesus-Garcia Filho , head of the discipline of Orthopedics at the Federal University of Sao Paulo ( UNIFESP ) and the coordinator of the university 's research program .
Myofascial pain has as its most evident symptom persistent muscular pains .
Comparative studies carried out with the cream from Cordia and that of the diclofenac derivative that are used in the phyto-medications , resulted in fewer side effects for the patients using the Cordia cream such as reddening on the applied location .
" Even being used on skin , we had within the control group ( using the diclofenac derivative ) a patient with a headache related to the use of this medication and another with a stomach ache , showing that they had significant absorption .
In the case of the group using the Cordia cream there was no compromising situation of this type , " Jesus-Garcia explains .
The Cordia cream demonstrated therapeutic signs when used three times per day .
" Within all of the parameters that we analyzed during the comparison between the two medications , among them efficiency and side effects , the Cordia verbenacea cream showed a tendency towards improved results , but they were not statistically significant , " Jesus-Garcia Filho says .
In order to obtain the necessary statistical comparison , the number of patients will need to be increased .
The idea of turning the knowledge of the fishermen of the São Paulo coast , who for a considerable time had been using the plant to treat bruises and to stanch inflammatory processes , came about from the habit of one of the owners and founders of Aché , Victor Siaulys , of using the Cordia after soccer games .
He noted that when the has always used the " bottle " -- a locally prepared medicinal infusion of the plant -- on his sprains and bruises he recovered much more quickly .
This verification gave him the incentive to push ahead with the idea of creating a research and development area for phyto-medications within the company in 1989 .
" As it was something totally new at that time , we encountered many difficulties , " explains Lazzarini .
Proven action -- The project went on unsteadily until 1998 , when it really got off the ground after a consultation with the pharmacologist João Batista Calixto , a professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina ( UFSC ) .
During 2001 the consultant Luís Francisco Pianowski , a specialist in the area of pharmaceutical technology , joined the group .
Together , Calixto and Pianowski discovered that the main active ingredient of the plant , responsible for the anti-inflammatory action was not the one described up until then in the literature , the compound artemetin , of the flavonoids group , but alpha-humulene , a compound of the essential oil .
But up until that point its anti-inflammatory effect was not known .
" This was the major discovery , " Lazzarini emphasizes .
The action of alpha-humulene as an anti-inflammatory was proven both in the pre-clinical tests with mice , and during the clinical tests on humans .
In order to produce a phyto-medication it is not necessary to isolate the main active ingredient , as in the case of allopathic medications .
As one is dealing with a phyto-complex , in many cases with more than fifty ( 50 ) substances , not always is it known what is effectively acting on its own and in a group .
" In our case , in the tests on animals we could prove that the alpha-humulene was responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect , " advised the medical doctor , Dagoberto Brandão , the owner of Pharma Consulting , a research and development consulting company and the coordinator of the pre-clinical and clinical studies of the new product .
Both the oils of essence and the relevant flavonoids for the medication are concentrated in the leaves of the popularly known " erva-baleeira " ( Cordia ) , a shrub mainly found along the coast of the southeast region of the state .
The studies relating to its cultivation and the extraction of the plant 's active ingredient , that cover agronomy , chemical and phyto-chemical development , were carried out at the Chemical , Biological and Agricultural Research Center ( CPQBA ) of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and coordinated by the researcher Pedro Melillo de Magalhães .
" The objective of the agronomy research was to establish a production system on a scale of growing the amount necessary to attend to the production demand , " researcher Magalhães says .
An area of the research center in the Paulínia region , close to the city of Campinas , with twelve ( 12 ) cultivated hectares of Cordia is the guarantee of the provision of the raw material in a quantity sufficiently large to deal with the first phase of the product 's launch .
Within this growing area , every four months the shrubs that are going to be used are cut a few centimeters from the base .
From the same cut off trunk , new shoots sprout up and so on successively .
The offshoots of the Cordia planted at the start of the project are still producing in the field .
The extraction of the essential oil , the raw material necessary for the laboratory to make up the final formula , is also done at the research center of Unicamp , which has a supply agreement with Aché .
Biological markers guarantee the quality and consistency of the extract , which cannot have variation in order to guarantee the standard of the raw material .
" There can 't be any variation in the concentration of the principal active ingredients , all of them have to be the same as before , " says Brandão .
Standardization is one of the demands of an Anvisa resolution , dating from March of 2004 , for the production of phytomedications .
And this resolution has as its objective to control both the vegetal raw material and the medications themselves .
In the clinical tests a standardized extract equivalent to that which is going on the market was used .
With agronomists , biochemists , pharmacologists and medical doctors , there have been more than one hundred professionals involved with the project between 1998 and 2004 .
The pre-clinical studies involved pharmacological and toxicological tests in laboratories and afterwards with mice .
" The clinical research was carried out at university centers and followed the rigorous directives of the National Health Council and those of Anvisa , " Brandão emphasizes .
The clinical tests were done in three stages , with the participation of almost seven hundred ( 700 ) patients .
During phase 1 , the product was tested on around two hundred and seventy ( 270 ) healthy volunteers , in phase 2 around ninety ( 90 ) patients suffering from chronic tendinitis and from myofacial pain and in phase 3 there were approximately two hundred and eighty ( 280 ) patients with the same illnesses .
Similar studies were carried at the Orthopedics Department of UNIFESP and at the Medical Faculty of the Catholic Pontifical University of Campinas ( Puccamp ) .
After having complied with all of the stages of pre-clinical and clinical testing , Aché sent off a request for registration to Anvisa , approved in November of last year , to use Acheflan in cases of tendinitis and myofascial pain .
Now the laboratory is researching the use of the extract in the form of a pill for the same ailments .
And also , is beginning to study the use of Cordia for osteoarthritis and physical traumas .
During the seven years in which the project was taken forward without interruption , the Aché company has invested more than R $ 15 million in the research and development of this phyto-medication .
The company , which last year had a gross income of R $ 900 million , has annually applied R $ 10 million in the research and development of new products .
Billionaire market -- For now , the launch of Acheflan is restricted to the national market , which moves around R $ 400 million per year only with phytotherapeutic medications .
Some phyt-therapeutics that are on sale , such as teas and capsules of natural products , do not fit into the category of medicines and for this reason they do not enter into this calculation .
Abroad , this segment tallies up to US $ 21 billion per year .
For this reason , conquering a slice of this billionaire market is one of the company 's goals .
" We have been in conversation with possible partners in Europe and the United States and we have various of them interested , " says Lazzarini .
" We are now in the phase of evaluation . "
The company has other eight phyto-medication projects , but they are not saying what they involve as the patents are not yet registered .
In order to develop the projects in this area they created a division called Phytomédica , which has presented as its first research and development result a product indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of post-menopause based on isoflavons of Soya , often used in China , from where it originated , as well as Japan .
Nevertheless , the new phytomedication was made from a Brazilian plant .
The research was totally carried out in Brazil , right from the agronomy , chemical and phyto-chemical studies to the formula of the final product .
" The interesting fact is that it sprung up from an idea that went well , " says Jesus-Garcia Filho .

Vital implant
The first national stent produced by laser is going to reduce the cost of cardiac therapies
Yuri Vasconcelos
To dominate the technology for the production of coronary stents could lead Brazil to participate in the group of countries that manufacture these devices inserted into the veins or arteries by way of angioplasty surgery with the objective of unblocking them so that the blood flows normally .
The first step for the national production of these prostheses was taken at the beginning of March at the Heart Institute ( InCor ) of Sao Paulo , with the placing of a stent in the artery of a rabbit .
The small metal part was developed by the São Paulo company LaserTools , which produced it by way of laser beams .
The procedure represents the start of a long process of clinical testing that will culminate with tests on human beings within approximately one year .
Only then , should the results be satisfactory , will the device get the green light of the National Agency for sanitary Vigilance ( Anvisa ) for commercial use .
" We are confident that this is going to happen to two to three years .
Up until then we shall have to knock down some barriers , " says the physicist and researcher Spero Penha Morato , a partner at LaserTools .
The manufacture of this implant is of major importance , because there is Brazil a demand to the order of 90,000 coronary stents per year and all of these devices are imported .
The manufacture of stents by LaserTools has made up part of the company 's objectives over the last seven years .
" We have perceived the possibility of producing these bio-compatible metallic implants since the founding of the company in 1998 , " says Morato .
" But , in order to manage to develop the device , we had to create a network of partners , because the laser cut , which is our specialty , is only the first step in the manufacture of the product .
After this comes the development phase for us to arrive at a stent the same as or even better than the imported models , which are coated with pharmacological products , " the researcher goes on .
This coating serves to avoid the proliferation of scar tissue on the artery wall that can cause a new obstruction in the blood vessel , even with the presence of the stent .
Multidisciplinary team - The first partnership was established at the start of 2003 with the company called Scitech Medical , from Goiânia , which specializes in the commercialization of stents .
" At the end of that year , when reading an article in the Pesquisa FAPESP magazine ( Issue No. 94 of December 2003 ) , I got to know about the work of professor Marcelo Ganzarolli de Oliveira , from the Chemistry Institute of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , who had developed polymer films used for coating stents and I invited him into our group , which also included a team from InCor , " Morato recalls .
At that time , LaserTools had begun its second phase of the Small Business Innovation Technology ( PIPE ) program through FAPESP , directed exclusively to the creation of bio-compatible medical implants , such as coronary stents and peripherals ( indicated for implanting in other arteries of the body ) , distracter ( bone stretcher ) , titanium screen netting ( serves for bone integration and are used in orthopedic and mandibular surgery ) , clips for aneurism and spine implants , all of them cut using a laser .
" The development of these devices gave origin to a new business unit , which ended up transforming itself into the company named Inovatech Medical , which will produce the stents , " affirmed researcher Morato .
Just like LaserTools at the start of its history , Inovatech is located at the Technology Companies Incubator Center ( Cietec ) , installed at University City in Sao Paulo .
Right from the first PIPE project , that began in 1998 , LaserTools has been developing laser processes for various segments of industry , as well as relief engravings .
The stent and other biomedical products , nevertheless , have marked a new phase in the company .
They are delicate products for implanting into the human body that require a meticulous production process .
Each piece , measuring 18 mm ) in length and 1.8 mm in breadth is cut in the form of a very fine metallic mesh netting made from a tube of stainless steel with special specifications .
The thickness of the mesh wall is around 100 microns ( 1 micron is a one thousandth part of a millimeter ) and the laser cuts for transforming the tubing into a mesh are done with a precision of 20 microns .
After cutting , the stent is chemically immersed for the removal of oxidation that might appear during the production .
The next stage consists of thermal treatment under high vacuum for relieving any tensions caused by the laser cut and also there is electro-polishing to give it a final finish .
Finally the device passes through a sterilization process and is then ready to be implanted or to be recoated with a polymer coating .
The stent implanted in the rabbit in March at the InCor hospital is a simple steel model , without any type of coating .
The device will remain for thirty ( 30 ) days on the rabbit 's artery , of caliber similar to that of a human coronary , and afterwards will be removed for evaluation .
In the first phase of the tests , three different type of stent will be implanted in nine rabbits : steel without a coating , steel coated with a polymer and steel coated with a polymer embedded with drugs .
Tests are also forecast with stents made with other metal alloys and with differentiated designs .
Once the implants in the rabbits have been concluded , the next procedure will be to test the metallic sheeting in the coronary arteries of pigs .
In these animals the stent evaluation is carried out six months after implanting .
Refined tests - " These experimental stages , which should be up to a year in duration , are fundamental for the correct conducting , from the scientific point of view , of the development of this type of device .
The studies on experimental animals , rabbits and then pigs , are very important for estimating the safety and efficiency of the device being tested .
They also serve to refine the technology of the confectioning of devices under development . , " affirmed the medical doctor , Pedro Lemos , from the Hemodynamic and Intervention Cardiology Service of InCor , responsible for the implants .
" Only after the animal study phase , when we have reached a conclusion in relation to the final format of the stent , is when we can begin to move to the phase of clinical tests on patients , which should last up to six months at the very minimum , " advised Dr. Lemos .
The cost of a national stent has as yet not been defined , but , according to researcher Spero , when they are launched on the market they will be cheaper than similar imported models , which cost from R $ 4,5000.00 ( steel model ) to R $ 15,000.00 ( with a drug coating ) .
" The price is going to depend on the volume that are placed on the market , " affirmed the researcher who hopes to produce sufficient to attend to the national demand and to export to the neighboring countries of Mercosul and other countries .

Body heat
Equipment detects temperature variations by way of infrared radiation
When fevers , infections or pains cannot have their cause immediately defined , this is when more precise exams are needed to decipher these symptoms and to discover the origin of any illness .
One of the ways of making this diagnosis is to measure the temperature of the body by way of infrared radiation .
According to the temperature variation in determined parts of the body , it is possible to verify the incidence or not of debilitating factors in the organism .
This variation is detected by a thermographic camera that registers the radiation and then transforms it into a thermal image capable of representing , point by point , the surface temperature of a body .
The equipment assists in the detection of illnesses such as cancer , leprosy , diabetes , lesions caused by repetitive stress injuries ( RSIs ) and other inflammatory situations , and can even be used in sports medicine .
These cameras , which also measure the temperature of industrial equipment , are widely used in some countries , but as yet little used in Brazil due to their high cost .
This is a situation that is beginning to change through the work of researchers at the Physics Institute of the University of Sao Paulo in Sao Carlos ( IFSC / USP ) .
They have built , for the first time in the country , two prototypes of a thermographic camera capable of carrying out exams at a distance and of a non-invasive mode .
At the size of a conventional video camera , which should facilitate its use in hospitals , health centers and clinics , the equipment developed , with FAPESP 's financial support , captures the images based on a single sensor , in which each point of focused heat is codified by a color standard .
In order to detect the images , two mirrors move in a synchronized manner in different directions , vertically and horizontally , making a complete sweep over all of the points of image to be registered .
Captured by the object lens of the camera , the infrared radiation is reflected in the mirrors , arriving at the sensor by way of a lens totally transparent to this type of electromagnetic wave .
The camera is linked to a computer and the captured images are saved and analyzed by a piece of software , also developed at the laboratory .
With the exception of the sensor , imported and without something nationally similar , all of the thermographic camera 's items were manufactured in Brazil .
It is prepared to measure temperatures between 18 ° C and 40 ° C , variations existing on the skin of the human body .
To guarantee this performance , there is a calibration method with controlled standards of temperature and that was also developed by the group .
This calibration guarantees the sensitivity to 0.1ºC within the band used for health applications .
For industrial use , it could be programmed to measure temperatures in much higher bands , up to 1,000ºC .
Technological domination -- According to Luiz Antônio de Oliveira Nunes , who coordinated the research in the Lasers and Applications Laboratory of IFSC / USP , the thermographic camera cannot be patented , because innovating technology does not exist within it , only the mastery of the technology , that has already been published and is public .
" Our camera is not a copy , the project is ours and novelties exist , but they do not justify a patent .
Our strategy is to master imported technologies , commercially available , but as yet not produced in the country .
After dominating the technology , we want to produce it on an industrial scale , " he reveals .
The national camera has no timescale to reach the national market because as yet it is not established who is going to manufacture it .
Nunes is looking for partnerships with companies in order to turn the production viable .
The cost of the camera is still expensive , around US $ 10,000.00 , but is a price one third of that of a similar imported model .
The market for this type of equipment is hospitals , health clinics and even airports .
In the area of clinical esthetics , the incidence of cellulite could be better evaluated with thermographic cameras , that show where the flux of heat id blocked by fat , even for problems just starting .
Another possibility is veterinary use .
" For example , if a race horse has a muscular problem , one will only need to photograph it with the camera to know its true conditions for a race . "
All of the tests with the camera were performed at the laboratory level , with infrared from the IFSC / USP itself , under the guidance of the medical doctor Antonio Carlos de Camargo Andrade Filho , from the Lauro de Souza Lima Institute of Bauru , who specializes in pain therapies .
" The clinical teats have already been concluded and have proved that the camera helps in diagnostic analysis both for unknown pains and for skin illnesses and superficial tumors , as well as allowing for accompanying the vitality of the skin , " Dr. Andrade Filho advised .
Industrial use -- As well as medical use , this type of technology also allows for the evaluation of thermal loses in machinery and installations , improving the performance of equipment in use or under development in industry .
For this reason , contrary to what occurs in the medical area , in industry thermographic technology is already widely used .
Measurements in electrical panels of force fields , for example , reveal loses of energy very often brought about by a simple poor contact ( the higher the temperature the greater the energy loss ) .
In the automobile industry the equipment could verify if heaters and the windscreen demisters have been well installed .
In steel making it could reveal a leak of heat in the high temperature furnaces , in plants , boilers , and refrigeration systems .
In the Armed Forces thermographic cameras are used in high precision equipment , principally installed in military aircraft .
The military application of thermography began back in the 1940s , and that of medicine in the 1960s .
The first infrared camera was developed in 1948 and was capable of registering an image after twenty ( 20 ) minutes .
The camera developed at the IFSC / USP makes an image in only three seconds , but a camera with military application is already capable of registering up to one thousand images per second .

The Ninth Art
Researches , archives , a book and a thesis show that comic books still maintain their importance
Carlos Haag
Gone is the time when mothers were right to shout : " Laddie , stop reading comics and get studying ! "
Today , the two activities go hand in hand and are found at the university .
" Comic books are too important to be left as hostages to the circumstances .
Unfortunately , for a long time they were regarded as second or third class material by influential portions of society , " explains Waldomiro Vergueiro , a professor of the Communications and Arts School ( ECA ) and the coordinator of USP 's Comic Book Research Nucleus .
Believing in the value of the " ninth art , " Nogueira , with support from FAPESP , carried out the General Directory of Comic Books in Brazil project , which makes available on the Internet ( www.eca.usp.br / agaque ) a catalog of all the titles of comic books published in the country .
" The project aims at the preservation of the national comic strip memory . "
This lack of interest for the " little magazines " calls for an explanation , because how can one despise a medium that , in the 1960s , came to sell an amazing 240 million copies a year , in a country where the population did not exceed 55 million ?
" Of the four largest businessmen of the Brazilian press in the 20th century , three began in the magazine segment as publishers of comic books : Roberto Marinho , Adolfo Aizen and Victor Civita ( Abril was born , in 1950 , with a comic book , O raio vermelho [ The red ray ] , and , afterwards , carried off the market with Donald Duck ) .
Today 's mega-conglomerate publishing house Record , of Alfredo Machado , began as Brazil 's first distributor of comic books .
These businessmen set up their publishing empires for the lucrative comic book business , the sales of which gave a push to their businesses , " explains Gonçalo Junior , the author of A guerra dos gibis [ The war of the comic books ] ( Companhia das Letras , 448 pages , R $ 52 ) , a history of the impact of the comic books ' arrival in Brazil .
And what a rumpus .
In 30 years , they were a fulcrum for the national press and they mobilized , in favor and against , the biggest figures of the time , including Presidents Getúlio Vargas , Juscelino Kubitschek , Jânio Quadros , João Goulart and Castello Branco , as well as Carlos Lacerda ( an enemy of the comic books that , he used to say , had the power of leading the young astray and taking them to communism " ) , Gilberto Freyre ( an ardent fan who , as a deputy , tried to convince Congress to launch the recently promulgated Constitution in a comic book version ) , Jorge Amado ( who attributed his popularity to the versions made in comic strips of his first books ) , journalists Samuel Wainer and Orlando Dantas ( whose moral crusades against the magazines hid a fight for market with Marinho ) .
In spite of the prejudice that beset them , the comic books may have been born in Brazil , in 1869 , with the Adventures of Nhô Quim , by Ângelo Agostini .
That is , 30 years before the publication in the United States of Yellow Kid , regarded by many as the " pioneer . "
Agostini , incidentally , is back again with the facsimile reissue of his illustrated criticism of " São Paulo provincialism , " Diabo coxo [ Crippled devil ] , launched by Edusp ( 216 pages , R $ 65 ) , recovered by two professors from USP , Ana Maria Camargo and Luiz Cagnin .
But , in spite of their success abroad , comic books did not awaken the interest of Brazilian publishers for decades , until , in 1934 , Adolfo Aizen , a journalist from Roberto Marinho 's O Globo , saw , on a trip to the United States , the success that the daily supplements ( feminine , sports , children 's etc . ) of the American newspapers enjoyed , and wanted to repeat the formula in his paper .
But he came up against the lack of interest of the owner , which led him to turn to a competitor to put his idea into practice .
The result was a peak in the sales of the periodical on the day that the so-called comic strip stories , a reproduction of the American strips , came out .
It was the silent start of the " comic book war , " as Marinho realized his mistake and reacted , a little later , by launching the Juvenile Globo , an imitation of Aizen 's supplement .
Edited , by the way , by Nelson Rodrigues , who , without knowing English , would look at the drawing and fill in the balloons with his texts .
Aizen , though , did not give in lightly and brought another novelty , the comic books , in the format of a little magazine , an innovation also copied by Marinho in Gibi ( a synonym for scamp ) .
New enemies entered the battlefield : seeing the magazines ' potential , Assis Chateaubriand did his , O Guri [ The Kid ] , where he launched Captain America and Batman ( shortly before , Aizen had launched Superman ) .
first attacks on the comic books , he wrote , were made by padres who , Italian in the majority , prayed by the missal of Mussolini , an inflexible opponent of comic books , which , he would bellow , " were denationalizing youth . "
The tone of censure gradually rose in volume and in political power : in 1946 , Carlos Lacerda , in a speech , defined comic books as " poison imported for the children , " since , according to him , the number of " communist " comic book writers had multiplied .
Shortly before , in 1944 , the National Institute of Pedagogical Studies , of the Ministry of Education , had disclosed a study that accused comic books of causing mental sloth and discouraging learning and the reading of books .
" That is why , all over the country , schools and parishes organized monumental bonfires to burn comic books , " Gonçalo says .
The phobia about comic books went so far as to generate a law , in 1949 , of the authorship of the then alderman Jânio Quadros , to " prevent reading that was offensive to good behavior " from being exposed in newsstands and bookshops .
God does not admit supermen , supermonkeys , or super Robertos Marinhos . "
The fight was heating up .
Orlando Dantas , from O Diário de Notícias , and Samuel Wainer , from Última Hora , dedicated several pages to show that the comic strips were " factories of little criminals , " and comic books " veritable manuals of crime . "
" Because of a quarrel between Marinho and Dantas for leadership in the newspaper market , repression of comic books was institutionalized in the country .
I do not believe that padres and teachers would manage to make so much noise and pressure if Marinho 's adversaries had not attacked because of his comic strip magazines . "
An article of the times told how , in a reformatory , a black adolescent called Lilico , the " terror of the suburbs , " scorned books by Monteiro Lobato .
" That 's stuff for kiddies .
I want Gibi , O Guri .
" The current prejudice against comic books is an accursed inheritance from those days .
Even today it is very strong , even in schools of communication , " Gonçalo laments .
After the moralists , comic books came under the nationalist attack .
In 1961 , the Brazilian comic strip writers , amongst them Ziraldo , the author of Pererê , and Mauricio de Sousa , the father of Mônica , demanded of the government a law nationalizing comic books , which included a 70 % market reserve for the Brazilians .
The first to embrace the cause was Leonel Brizola , then governor of Rio Grande do Sul , which subsidized national comic books .
" Part of the texts of the magazines was pamphletary and committed to Brizola 's nationalist ideas . "
In 1963 , Goulart signed a decree-law that " regulated the production of comic books in Brazil , " an act confirmed by the military in 1966 , but never applied .
" The Brazilian artists also wanted to create , in their association , a department for censuring the American comic books , " Gonçalo reveals .
Amongst the " censors " was Ziraldo , so much combated during the dictatorship .
" It was all fruit of a lack of professional vision that remains with us .
There are still those who say that the syndicates dominate the market and are asphyxiating our poor artists .
Well , they have disappeared from the market , and even so the situation is not good .
Comic books are undergoing their worst moment in over a century of history , " he warns .
" In the 1970s , the magazine that sold less than 200,000 copies would vanish .
In the 1990s , the cutoff line stood at 55,000 copies and , nowadays , the publishers print between 2,000 and 5,000 . "
Gonçalo regrets what he calls the " arrogance " of many Brazilian comic strip writers who hide their deficiencies behind the so-called " foreign threat . "
" They neglect the quality of the plots and do not look for professional means of production .
We are still amateurs , provincials . "
If this " imperialism " of comic books is doubtful , one fact is undeniable for the author : " The comic books were very important in the dissemination of American culture in Brazil .
Our children grew up reading American comic books . "
And , perhaps , picking up other vices .
Selma Regina Oliveira , from the School of Communication of the University of Brasilia ( UnB ) , defends , in her doctoral thesis , Woman to the power of two , that the American comic books helped to reinforce sexist stereotypes by showing defenseless , virginal girls , always needing the help of the superheroes , they , in turn , strong men , perfect gods .
Even fascinating female villains like Catwoman , she says , depend in the end on a Batman to get out of their scrapes .
" The bad woman of the comic books is more instigating than the good little one , but the man always stays with the latter , " the researcher notes .
There is a lot of balloon to be deciphered and , counter to what mum used to say , it seems the time has come to get the comic books and study .

Doctors or monsters ?
Slavery drove the development of tropical medicine
" We have arrived at the greatest scourge that I have seen of these inhabitants of this part of Minas , an ailment that certainly fools all the beginners in this climate , both surgeons and doctors , because , doing what they studied and the authors taught , they see no effect from their diligence , if they see some in one , do not see any in a hundred .
I speak from experience and feeling very sad for that principle , seeing that this disease was very common and that so many slaves died and so much gold was lost in so few days , " noted , in Luís Gomes Ferreira in his Erário Mineral [ Mineral Treasure ] , annotations made by him about diseases experienced or observed in Minas Gerais in the 18th century .
Ferreira was one of the many surgeons or " practical doctors " who were at work in Brazil and whose education had been acquired in the daily toil with the sick .
Unlike the doctors , in far lesser numbers and more respected for their European academic education , practical doctors like Ferreira dealt with the day to day of colonial ailments , " experimenting " and often " being mistaken . "
When this happened , they would be " very sad . "
After all , a slave dead was gold lost .
Accordingly , surgeons were widely employed in Brazil , using much of the traditional knowledge of the medicine from different communities ( blacks , ' bandeirante ' bands of adventurers etc . ) , blending it with the knowledge of Western medicine .
" From the exoticism of the diseases present in the crossings and conquests , from the need for improvising therapies and remedies , from the scarceness of physicians in the new lands and from the vast experimentalism of the surgeons , there came as a result guides to medical practice valued in the kingdom and in the colony , as was the Erário Mineral , " explains Maria Cristina Cortez Wissenbach , who , in her doctoral thesis , Medical matter , slavery and traffic in Brazil , supported by FAPESP , analyzed the so-called manuals of practical medicine .
These , if at first they were used for the treatment of slaves , who acted as " guinea pigs , " were used later to treat the rest of the population .
Unusually , Brazilian medicine is in debt to this not very altruistic concern in keeping the slaves alive for work .
Worse still : these surgeons contributed equally to the optimization of slave trafficking , choosing the best individuals and taking care of the many who fell sick on the journey from Africa to Brazil .
" A good part of tropical medicine was born on board the slave ships , " says Cristina .
Hardly a noble origin .
But necessary in a world driven by slavery .
After all , in a 60-day crossing , it was common for over half of the 500 to 800 blacks heaped up in the holds to die of smallpox , and , even with the supervision of the surgeons , mortality on the ships would be in the region of 10 % to 20 % .
" But by taking care of one of the most important stages in the trading of slaves , the surgeons became acute observers of physical qualities and defects , of the evidences of age , of the symptoms of diseases or predispositions to ailments , that the merchants would often try to hide , " the historian says .
It is , though , worth pointing out that this concern with getting to know the diseases of the blacks was aimed more at the market than at the human side .
Each loss meant a reduction in the profit .
On land as at sea .
" It was cheaper to exploit the slave to the utmost and to replace him when he was ill , " the historian explains .
The surgeons would use the knowledge acquired in their practice , as active participants in the slave trade , to add value to the so-called rejected " pieces . "
" I also observed in that country that there were men of little resources who would employ themselves in buying the remainder of the slaves , for which the commissioner had no purchaser ( ... ) , taking them home , medicating them , and giving them their upkeep and the necessary clothing , and bringing about a change in them ; with the despised slave convalescing , within a short time , they would resell him as a healthy , robust and strong one , for a very good price : and they would continue with this traffic , devoting themselves to a new kind of industry , " reported Luís Antônio de Oliveira Mendes , in a text written to the Royal Academy of Sciences , in Lisbon , at the end of the 18th century .
These expedients gave the surgeons the chance to raise their earnings , since they were often the only means of alleviating the pain of the sick , given the scarcity of doctors educated in Europe .
" Once established , these practical doctors would transform themselves into lords of sugar mills , well-heeled traders or peddlers , or owners of mines , and the exercise of the functions connected with heath often appears in a circumstantial way , possibly as an imposition of a needy society that had a demand for their services , " the researcher clarifies .
To help their enrichment even more , there was the difficult access to medicines in the colony , which led Brazil to absorb with ease the practitioners of health , since they met the demands and assimilated the local knowledge .
Little by little , the oriental and European products of traditional medicine were replaced by others from the local pharmacopoeia .
A common characteristic is the little distinction that there was between scientific and popular knowledge , a mosaic of teachings from Iberian , indigenous , African , Brazilian backland and Jesuit popular medicine .
Although , the researcher explains , it is impossible to dimension the proportion there was between doctors and surgeons between the 17th and 18th centuries , some reports indicate that there were only three surgeons for the 30,000 persons who inhabited Recife at the beginning of the 1700s , or no more than two doctors and seven surgeons in Belém , at the end of the same century now , for a population of 11,000 .
Suffice it to recall that , when reporting that scurvy was the fruit of a lack of vitamin C , the manuals taught the captains of slave ships to stock them with greens and the juices of citrus fruits to prevent the disease .
But not just them : the colonial world was able to expand in its maritime frontiers , benefited by this knowledge .
Knowledge that , in a short time , was enriched by other similar experiences , carried out in other parts of the globe .
In the comparison between the various works analyzed in her thesis , the researcher observed inflections in the medical knowledge that , if until the first half of the 18th century was limited to the Portuguese and Luso-Brazilian experiences , from the last few decades of that century came to absorb as well the knowledge about the diseases from the other colonial areas .
The vicious circle , with time and the end of slavery , was transformed into a virtuous one , saving lives , never mind the color of the skin .
Medicine was overcoming the pragmatism of the profits .

Among the stars
The work of César Lattes , who died at eighty years , was fundamental for the detection of the pi meson
Neldson Marcolin
" The working conditions here are excellent .
I can work on what really interests me and stay as long as I like .
It 's a real piece of cake ! "
César Lattes when writing to Leite Lopes on the 21st of April 1946
" I 'm perfectly happy to go to work here under conditions that are much less favorable ( I 'm referring to the scientific part and the material possibility of research , not to the professional part ) because I believe that it 's much more interesting and difficult to form a good school in a precarious environment than to earn a Nobel prize working in the best physics laboratory in the world . "
César Lattes to Leite Lopes on the 12th August 1946
The two paragraphs above , written by César Lattes , have an interval of less than four months .
They make up part of the letters written from Bristol , in England , to José Leite Lopes , in Rio de Janeiro .
Professor Lattes was just turning twenty-three and would carry out the two studies that would shoot him into the constellation of scientific stars during the following years of 1947 and 1948 .
From the extracts one can notice the fascination with the working conditions found at the H.H .
Wills Laboratory , at the University of Bristol , and his concern in setting up competitive teams for physics work in Brazil , especially in Rio .
Cesar Lattes died at the age of eighty on the 9th of March in Campinas as a result of a sudden heart attack , having been the most recognized Brazilian physicist who used his enormous prestige acquired through his discoveries to set up laboratories in Rio , São Paulo and Campinas , and remained faithful to his ideas of youth .
The letters are in the book , Uma história da física no Brasil [ A history of physics in Brazil ] , by Leite Lopes , organized by Amélia Império Hamburger ( Physics Editorial Bookshop , 2004 ) .
The Italian physicist Giuseppe Occhialini ( cited by Lattes ) had worked in Brazil , beginning in 1938 with Gleb Wataghin , the Ukrainian naturalized Italian , who had already given lectures at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) right from its foundation , in 1934 .
With professor Wataghin and a group of highly talented Brazilians , such as Mário Schenberg from the state of Pernambucano and Marcello Damy de Souza Santos and Paulus Aulus Pompéia , from the state of São Paulo , among various others , professor Occhialini carried out research into cosmic rays and was one of Lattes ' teachers .
The original name of the Brazilian was , in reality , Cesare Mansueto Giulio Lattes , born in the city of Curitiba on the 11th of July 1924 , the son of the Italian immigrants Giuseppe and Carolina .
His father , then living in Sao Paulo , perceived Cesar 's inclination towards mathematics and physics and introduced him to professor Wataghin , whom he knew .
Making use of a loophole in a government judicial directive , young Lattes skipped a a few years and enrolled in the at that time Philosophy , Science and Arts School ( FFCL / USP ) .
By the age of nineteen he had graduated and joined Wataghin 's team as his third assistant .
They kept the library updated , there was continuous exchange programs with the largest research centers in the world and they made every effort to send their Brazilian disciples abroad .
" It wasn 't England or the United States that gave me my physics education .
It occurred in Sao Paulo , with Wataghin and Occhialini and of course Damy , " said professor Lattes in an interview published in the magazine Ciência Hoje in August of 1995 .
" That is to say , I learned nothing from them apart from the English language . "
In 1945 , Occhialini went to Bristol to work with Cecil Powell , who was using common photographic plates for the study of the reactions in the atom 's nucleus .
One year later , Lattes followed the same pathway and joined professor Powell 's team .
The procedure for the detection of particles was to expose the plates , covered in emulsion , to the open air ( similar to common photographic film ) .
The emulsion detects the passage of the highly energetic particles , electrically charged .
After developing , the plate shows the particle 's trajectory ( observable under the microscope ) through the sequence of grains containing metallic silver along its course of direction .
It so happens that the particles that come from space ( cosmic rays ) collide with particles of the earth 's atmosphere creating other particles that are difficult to be detected .
For this reason , Occhialini and Lattes concluded that , besides the need for having plates with a more sensitive emulsion , it was also necessary to reduce the exposure time .
It would be necessary was to carry out the experiments at places of very high altitude , where the air is rarified .
Occhialini carried out the first high altitude experiment in France atop the mountain Pic du Midi , at 2,800 meters in 1946 .
On developing the plates , in January of 1947 , he found some particles and wrote a note for Nature exalting the advantages of the emulsion plates .
It so happened that the major leap forward had not only been to expose the plates at altitude but as well in professor Lattes ' suggestion of covering some of them with borax ( sodium tetraborate ) , which allowed the conservation of the particles ' marks for more time on the plate before they decayed into other particles .
The Brazilian and the Italian had been in search of mesons , subatomic particles that carry out the interaction between neutrons and protons , forecast by the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa in 1935 .
In the Andes , at that altitude , the plates received 100,000 times more cosmic particles than in France .
Everything worked out : the pi meson was clearly detected .
" Particle physics began here , " explains Igor Pacca , from the Astronomy , Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences Institute ( IAG / USP ) , who worked with professor Lattes between 1961 and 1966 .
Cesar Lattes wanted more .
In 1948 he exchanged Bristol for Berkeley University in the United States .
This time the idea was to use a particle accelerator to detect mesons artificially created .
Just two weeks after having arrived at Berkeley , Lattes and the American physicist Eugene Gardner detected the particle .
In truth , the pi mesons had already been produced artificially since November 1946 , what had not been known was how to identify them .
The news elevated professor Lattes to a position of major highlight on the world scientific scenario .
When his scholarship to Berkeley was completed , he already knew what he wanted to do : to work at the recently created Brazilian Center of Physics Research ( CBPF ) , in Rio , which he had helped to found .
During his period at the CBPF , he set up the Cosmic Physics Laboratory at Chacaltaya and made other lines of research possible .
However , in 1955 he left , having discovered financial irregularities at the center .
Lattes went to the United States and worked at the universities of Chicago and Minnesota .
He returned to USP in 1960 and mounted the photographic Emulsion Laboratory .
He actively participated in the International Cooperative Emulsion Flight , an international project for the analysis of part of a block of 80 liters of emulsion exposed by balloon in the Caribbean .
And from this period came the start of collaboration with Japanese researchers to study emulsions exposed at Chacaltaya .
During 1967 he transferred to the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and there he organized and directed the Cosmic Rays Department and the Nuclear Emulsions Laboratory .
César Lattes is almost always remembered as the Brazilian who came closest to winning a Nobel Prize .
For his work during 1947 , signed by him and Occhialini and Cecil Powell , who wound up winning the prize by himself in 1950 .
Powell headed the laboratory and had won for having developed a photographic method for the study of the nuclear process during the decade of the 40s and for the discoveries made using this method .
It is considered that he was to bring visibility to the work , to explore the potentiality of his group , reusing the results and , according to author Ana Maria Ribeiro , he had the talent to convince crowds .
Lattes could also have won for his detection of the artificial pi meson , but his co-author , Eugene Gardner , died suddenly in 1950 , and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm did not award prizes to dead scientists .
Apparently , the Brazilian did not get upset with the situation .
Lattes complained when he saw a text that was badly written .
" He would say : ' Go home and read Graciliano Ramos .
When you learn to correctly use adjectives you can write it out again and show it to me ' . "
According to people who were in daily contact with him , at times Lattes would alternate moments of extreme excitement during which he would forget to eat and sleep and would spend the whole night working , with periods of deep depression .
One of the rare criticisms that was made of him is that of not having left followers -- the same as is said of other great physicists such as professors Schenberg and Oscar Sala .
The point about which there is no discussion is the genius of the scientist , according to Igor Pacca : " In physics he will always be placed ahead of the others as he saw a long way beyond the others . "

One eye on reason , the other on the heart
Marcos Pivetta and Mariluce Moura
Further : she considers herself to be extremely lucky to be working on that which she adores .
She is also a woman capable of passionately taking up causes in which she believes and fighting , warrior like , for her points of view , as it could be seen in the days that anticipated the voting of the Biosafety Bill in the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia : all of a sudden her beautiful face seemed omnipresent on the television .
On the TV Globo national news , on the Sunday night TV program Fantástico , on anchorman Bóris Casoy 's talk show , apparently over the entire Brazilian media , there she was , being interviewed ; giving her opinion , serene and strong-minded ; defending research with embryonic stem cells , one of the new law 's most polemic points and explaining how in the future this could save thousands even perhaps millions of human lives .
Very discrete about her private life , it was with economy of words that the Brazilian Mayana Zatz , fifty seven years of age , born Mayana Eden in Israel , of Romanian parents , made reference to her family in this interview : she is recently separated and the mother of two boys .
She spoke a little about her routine , which is organized around hours and hours of work , but she includes the habit of daily jogging , which may in part explain her graceful silhouette and elegant figure .
In the pages that follow , it is possible to make more direct contact with a little of the practice and thinking of this fascinating personality from within the realms of the Brazilian scientific scenario that is indeed Mayana ( a fuller version of the interview can be found on the website : www.revistapesquisa.fapesp.br ) .
How did you discover your vocation for scientific research ?
But I also had a leaning towards medicine .
And consequently I remained between medicine and research , but for sure I had to be a scientist .
Where were you living at that time ?
-- I was here .
I came to Brazil when I was seven .
I was born in Israel , left , went to France and afterwards came to Brazil .
You came directly to São Paulo ?
-- It has always been São Paulo .
You were the taking a science course [ one of the kinds of high school courses of that time ; the other was classics , for those who would dedicate themselves to humanities ] , studying biology through which you then discovered genetics ?
-- Clearly we didn 't have molecular biology then , there was nothing of what exists today .
Where did you complete your high school ?
-- At the São Paulo State High School , at that time a super high school .
And I became one of his students .
Back then I was seventeen or eighteen .
He though that we must learn everything , all of the techniques that there were .
I have a lot of respect and admiration for professor Frota , to whom I owe a lot .
And then thirdly was the fact that he was the example of how to deal with patients , always with kindness and the human touch .
I graduated , wrote my master 's and doctorate theses at USP , again under the supervision of professor Frota , and afterwards did my post-doctorate work at UCLA ( the University of California , in Los Angeles ) .
How did you manage to link together a career as a researcher with work of a social assistance nature ?
We had studied those affected , the mothers , sisters and afterwards we explained all of this to the families , still then under the guidance of professor Frota .
Shortly after I returned , some students sought me out and asked to start researching , and one of the things that had intrigued me was to know what had happened to those families .
We had a very welcome surprise because the families understood the high risk and most of them had not had children .
But I was shocked to see the conditions of the children who had been born before genetic counseling and had no wheelchair , no access to physiotherapy or access to schooling , because nobody wanted to take them on .
This was even more shocking in the face of the gigantic support that I had seen in the United Sates for families with identical problems .
We went about mobilizing people , I used the money from my grant to have the statutes drafted and to pay for a lawyer ...
Did he already have a dystrophy problem ?
-- Yes , he did .
Is this occurrence very high ?
-- All of these illnesses have an occurrence of one child affected in every one thousand born .
Some adult forms exist , but in many cases it is infants or youths who die .
And what I always say is that it 's not a child or an adolescent who 's affected , but an entire family .
How did you come into contact with those suffering from muscular dystrophy ?
-- The first patient who caught my attention was a young girl who came for genetic counseling because she had three nephews affected by Duchenne dystrophy .
I was still a student .
Then together with professor Frota , I discovered an article that had been published about an enzyme that could help to define if she was a carrier or not .
I ended up studying this in research work that involved one thousand people , that I began during my master 's degree and continued during my doctorate degree .
And how did your work evolve up until the identification of the first genes involved with waist dystrophy ?
-- We had been working with enzymes until , at the start of the decade of the 80s , molecular biology began to be developed abroad .
We got left behind because we were doing nothing in this field .
Then Rita , who had just completed her doctorate , said she was willing to go abroad to learn this technology .
I got in touch with Kay Davies 's group in Oxford , UK , as she was the best at that time , and Rita went there .
And then another of my friends , Mariz Vainzof , who had been working with proteins , and with muscles , said she wanted to go to Canada to learn how they had been studying muscular proteins .
When the two of them returned , we set up this sector of molecular biology to study neuromuscular illnesses .
We managed to publish a lot of work ; we found new genes and in fact we managed to take an enormous qualitative leap forward .
I remember one of your reports about paternity secrets in this work on genetic counseling that for its part often generated immense fears in people that , if they knew the truth , would have nothing to fear .
How did you and your group get over this trauma in order to deal with the most complicated cases ?
Each case is a case in itself , but frequently it 's discovered that when a DNA exam is made there exists a paternity situation that is unexpected .
So , what are we going to do ?
One case in particular that you may remember was that of a girl whose father had hemophilia , and she had become pregnant .
She could be a carrier of this illness that , although it doesn 't show up in women , would give her a 50 % chance of having a hemophilic son .
Indeed , she came to us already with the pre-natal diagnosis .
When the exams were completed , it was seen that her father was not actually her biological father .
She herself was not risk at all , not in that particular pregnancy or in any other .
But she had a lot of love for that father and to have told her the truth could well have meant the destruction of all of the family .
So we had a difficult choice to make .
In the end , our idea was to talk with the mother who knew everything .
And , when people begin to discuss ethical questions in this field , like a heap of theories , I find it interesting to tell some very hairy practical cases .
The father felt guilty because he had believed that he had transmitted the mutation to his son .
Through a DNA exam , it was discovered that he was not the biological father .
Whereupon came that anguish : to tell or not to tell , that is the question ?
I told this story at a bioethical congress that had only lawyers in attendance and they told me : " Look , you could well be sued in both situations , if you tell or you don 't tell . "
In the end , did the supposed father get to know ?
I would like you talk a little about the national and internationals awards that you have conquered .
And afterwards , in 2003 , I was awarded the prize in Basic Medical Sciences from the Third World Academy .
It 's very fulfilling to win an award .
In the case of the Women in Science from L 'Oréal a pile of money goes with the prize , so we had a lovely and emotional party in Paris at the Unesco headquarters .
And national prizes ?
-- I 've won the Claudia Award , the Rotary Club Award and some others .
Before going on to stem cells , I 'd like you to speak a little about your Cepid ( Research , Innovation and Diffusion Center ) funded by FAPESP .
-- I 'm convinced that the Cepid was an extremely important initiative .
It created the possibility of not only associating various researchers , but of bringing together three trends : that of scientific and innovative research , the transfer of technology and thirdly the spreading of knowledge .
We 've learned a lot over these first five years and I believe that now we have the opportunity of making a very important advance .
In terms of research , the Center has allowed us to purchase equipment that would not have been possible with an isolated group and has given us the opportunity to inter-react .
In the area of technology transfer , we 've improved in attending to patients and the tendency is for continued improvement .
Today , annually how many patients are treated at the Center ?
How many researchers work in the center ?
-- There are ten full time researchers , but there are people who come and go , if we count each one with their trainee students , then there must be around one hundred people .
Over your many years of work , has your research team added up many people they have been in direct contact with ?
-- Only in neuromuscular illnesses we 're at number 21,000 , between patients and members of their family .
Today we 're following up the second generation of these patients .
In terms of the treatment of these illnesses , have you seen some effective changes ?
-- The major hope now lies exactly with stem cells , for this reason I battled so hard for them .
A lot was spoken about a decade ago concerning genetic therapy , but I see it much more distant than cellular therapy , which is an improvement to transplants .
In genetic therapy one has to manipulate the gene , you have to be sure that you 'll arrive at the right gene , whilst in cellular therapy there 's a substitution of the tissue .
-- The following has happened : as we have money for technical support -- it 's still only a little and we need much more -- we can get people who are highly qualified and skilled to carry out the technical part of the technological transfer , instead of students , as had been happening .
What exactly are these tests ?
-- Tests , for example , on the diagnosis of waist dystrophy , in which we find out which are the most frequent mutations .
The test for cystic fibrosis , which is not neuromuscular , but is the most common genetic illness in Caucasians , and in which you can have more than one thousand mutations , at the Center we have developed a test that manages to detect 80 % of these mutations .
And today , where are these tests available ?
-- Here at USP .
The only thing is that we have another battle on our hands : the Public Health System doesn 't pay for the cost of these exams .
We have a convention with the State Public Health Department only for neuromuscular illnesses .
For the others and for patients outside of São Paulo , we have nothing .
Is the cost of these tests very high ?
-- It depends .
They can cost between R $ 300 and R $ 500 , but if we think that because of them one no longer needs to carry out a muscular biopsy ; very often there is no need for the hospitalization of a child ; one can begin precocious treatment ; prevent the birth of others affected , etc .
Are these tests available through private laboratories ?
-- Some are .
But in truth , throughout the world there are reference centers of determined specific tests .
So we choose some illness for testing , because each one of them gives a lot of work , and consequently it 's not worth while everyone doing everything .
There is a group in the south of Brazil that works with metabolic problems .
It 's the same idea throughout the world .
We send DNA , in blood or saliva , for testing and we can receive the result throughout Brazil in order to make a diagnosis .
Why did you decide to take up the fight for the approval of research with stem cells extracted from human embryos ?
-- Besides my obvious interest in the scientific question , what mobilized me was my direct contact with patients .
This is the other side of the team on which I 'm playing .
It 's heart breaking to have to say to a father or mother that their son has an illness and that there 's nothing that can be done .
They become desperate and want to take their child to any place on earth .
I even encourage those who have the financial means to do that .
I believe that it 's important that they see and hear everything that there is in order to be certain that the best is being done right here .
I have attended to patients who had spoken all the time : " I 'm praying for your research to go well . "
The first bill , moved by the parliamentarian Aldo Rebelo ( Communist party of Brazil ) , allowed research with embryonic stem cells .
But in the end everything was to be allowed and everyone had been happy .
Then we began to get ourselves mobilized .
We divided up the project and a group re-wrote the part about the stem cells .
Another group dealt with transgenics , and we went back to Brasilia to talk to senators in search of support .
At that moment I met Drauzio Varella and I asked for his support : " You need to help us in this cause !
Give us some help through TV Globo . "
In the first place I got to understand how the Congress works , something about which I had had the slightest notion .
If you don 't interfere in an unwanted pregnancy , life goes on .
It is interrupted with an abortion .
They were created through the intervention of man because the couple could not manage to reproduce naturally .
We suffered major opposition from the Catholic Church .
I believe that the Brazilian Academy of Sciences supported us along with FAPESP as well .
However , I believe that the scientific community could have mobilized itself more effectively .
-- Those people in wheelchairs asked us if they could be heard -- and I believe they have that right .
They 're the people who suffer most , I always say this .
On the contrary , they demanded : " For the love of God , let us speak to these Parliamentarians , let them see us . "
And there was a difference in this mobilization : the presence of youngsters and children in wheelchairs .
Research can help these young people and not only the patients with Parkinson and Alzheimer ailments .
Good , bad or indifferent , he is there and has lived his life .
-- I 'm hoping that we can begin this year .
Many people have telephoned here offering themselves as guinea pigs for experimental treatment .
We don 't accept these kinds of offers .
Now they 're going to say they 're doing this with national cells .
Animal research did not need the new Biosafety Law for authorization .
So much so that you don 't really know if the dog is pregnant until the start of its second month .
But it 's difficult to make a lineage of stem cells from these embryos .
We know for sure that the stem cells of the umbilical cord are better than those of the marrow .
There 's no point in stocking your own son 's umbilical cord .
Outside of this , all that is being done at the moment is therapeutic trials .
Nobody knows how her recovery would have progressed if she hadn 't received the stem cells .
The same rationale holds true for heart case studies .
So , you don 't recommend guarding ones son 's umbilical cord then ?
But who 's going to guarantee that in three or four decades these cells will be viable for use ?
Who 's guaranteeing that the person who sells you the service for guarding the cord will be here to complete the service , even to begin a discussion ?
People are paying for something that has a minute chance of serving for anything .
Do you believe that embryonic stem cells , by theoretically being capable of
How can you say something like this without having done the research ?
We , for example , have been working with umbilical cord stem cells for more than two years , attempting to transform them into muscle .
But there 's no point in putting them into the organism and waiting to see if they play their role .
The technology for injecting stem cells into the body would be similar to that already in existence , for example , with leukemia treatment and transplants .
The part concerning the immune-suppressive situation has also advanced a lot .
-- The neuromuscular illnesses , which I am studying , may well be the simplest and the first to benefit from these studies .
In these illnesses a natural degeneration of the muscle occurs .
-- Not only did I not feel discriminated against , but I believe that it was a great advantage being a woman .
In spite of the fact that today we 're separated , we 're still good friends .
And I owe a lot to him .
There was a time when I didn 't have a grant , or had a very small grant , which wouldn 't even have paid the school fees .
Have you stopped to think that perhaps you 're the best known woman scientist in Brazil ?
The children painted the scientists full of crazy things , smoke coming from everywhere .
At least we have to de-mystify that image , showing that scientists can be women .
You don 't need to be that crazy thing .

A law for life
The Biosafety Law could not take up any other position other than that of the front cover of this issue of Pesquisa FAPESP .
This is because its final approval in Congress , last 2nd of March , and its sanctioning by president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , on the 24th of the same month , represents a clear and important advance in the country 's scientific and technological policy -- indeed , well understood and covered in-depth by the national media as a whole .
Throughout its twelve pages that , starting from page 24 , deal with the theme , the editors Claudia Izique and Marcos Pivetta take turns to show us the battles and the positions taken up among the different actors that has guaranteed a victory for the defenders of research with embryonic stem cells and transgenics ; the panorama of the current research with stem cells in the country and its possibilities of development under the new law ; and finally , the prospects , both in knowledge and economics , which open up with the chapter referring to genetically modified foods within the new legislation .
To complete this wide coverage we have made use of the fact that the geneticist Mayana Zatz has been transformed into a sort of symbolic figure in the fight for the approval of research with embryonic stem cells , to be our guest to the interviewee of this issue , starting on page 12 .
Clearly Mayana , a brilliant researcher , internationally recognized , listened to on this occasion by editor Pivetta and myself , could have appeared in one of our interviews for some considerable time now , and , de rigueur , the magazine has long been in debt to its readers .
We have taken this opportunity to remedy the situation .
One of the other highlights of this number , which for sure would have been the cover if it had not been for the Biosafety Law , is the report by the assistant science editor , Ricardo Zorzetto , starting on page 48 , about the results of the most recent research into sleep , ongoing at the Sleep Studies Center , one of the Cepids , or Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers , funded by FAPESP .
The most surprising of them , to be taken and re-examined with caution , speaks of the evidence found using rats in which the female hormone progesterone would be responsible under determined circumstances for penis erection .
Not always , it would seem , does testosterone rule .
If this is confirmed by new studies , we will certainly have in front of us a weighty change on the current knowledge of sexual hormones , and especially those of progesterone , estrogen and testosterone .
Also in the science section it is worth drawing attention to the article by editor Carlos Fioravanti , starting on page 62 , about new and unexpected properties of magnetic materials , discovered by a São Paulo and a Rio de Janeiro research group .
In the practical world , these properties already bring about dreaming , for example of refrigerators worked by materials capable of cooling or warming with considerable more efficiency when submitted to a magnetic field .
Anyhow , if dreams and sleep still have vast untapped regions , and perhaps even unreachable for a long time to come , the ups and downs , the peaks and valleys of the Brazilian relief map on the contrary are now unveiled with enormous clarity thanks to work produced by Embrapa , the Brazilian Agricultural research Corporation , from images captured by the space shuttle Endeavour , as told by our technology editor , Marcos Oliveira , beginning on page 72 .
And finally , it is worth while taking a fun dive into the universe of comic books , in order to confirm its past and its present -- powerful , indeed -- within the Brazilian cultural panorama .
The humanities editor , Carlos Haag , starting from page 86 , that new esearch and a fascinating book show that comics , in the style of He-Man from the decade of the 80s , is still a force to be reckoned with around here .
Interview >
From privation to excess of food
Fabrício Marques
Brazilian society has lived through rapid and radical transformations in the field of nutrition over the last few decades .
From hunger , which was the concern of the migrant Northeasterners up until the decade of the 1970s , the country also began to live with the spectacle of obesity that threatens even the poorest classes of the population .
The fifty- seven-year-old epidemiologist doctor Carlos Augusto Monteiro , has been dedicating himself for three decades to studying the so called phenomenon of ' nutritional transition ' in Brazil .
He has been searching to understand the causes and identify the implications for the perfecting of public policies in the area of food , nutrition and health .
To a large extent , having been able to count upon the research and publications of this researcher , Brazil is now being accorded the condition , recognized by the World Health organization ( WHO ) , of being one of the countries in the world that has been improving its documentation and analysis on the phenomenon of nutritional transition .
Since 1997 professor Monteiro has been co-directing a task force of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences about nutritional transition and , in this function , dedicated himself in particular to unveiling the relationships existing between poverty and obesity in the developing countries .
Recently the researcher was at the epicenter of a polemic situation with the federal government by reason of a publication from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE ) , according to which obesity has become a public health problem in the country that is much more serious than hunger , a scourge restricted to a few spots in the semi-arid Northeast .
The publication , which had massive publicity , was produced by a team of researchers and technicians from the IBGE and the Ministry of Health , under the Monteiro 's leadership .
The work was even criticized by the President of the Republic himself , who saw in the survey a challenge to the priority of his government in combating hunger .
Monteiro has remained serene , but does not dodge the polemic situation .
" I 'm praying to common sense that Brazil isn 't a country that suffers from illnesses due to shortage , due to absolute misery .
But when you objectively examine the evidence , you see that it 's not quite that way .
Public opinion , unfortunately , doesn 't always lie on the side of scientific knowledge , " he says .
Married , a father of two daughters , and a grandfather with four grandchildren , r Monteiro is not one of those doctors who nails down something and does the opposite in his personal life .
He looks after his eating habits , likes to exercise frequently and underlines the importance of professors setting good examples for their students .
Some time ago , when he was head of the Nutrition Department for the first time , he decided to create a smoke-free working zone , which was quickly followed by the other departments .
" It seems like something of little importance , but it 's not .
What is the specter of hunger in Brazil ?
-- The WHO considers that the chronic deficiency of energy in a population acquires the connotation of a public health problem when the proportion of thin adults , or that is to say , with a body mass index below 18.5 kilograms per meter to the square ( Kg / m2 ) , is higher than 5 % .
Percentages of thin individuals between 5 % and 10 % must be seen as a signal of alert and they justify monitoring , while percentages up to 5 % are normal and correspond to the fraction of thin people who normally exist in whatever population .
The average percentage of thin individuals in the adult Brazilian population , according to estimates of the national anthropometric inquiry carried out by the IBGE in 2003 , is some 4 % , which does not place the chronic deficiency of energy as a public health problem in the country as a whole .
Situations that justify monitoring the problem ( 6 to 7 % of thin individuals ) were found by the IBGE in the rural areas of the Northeast region , and in a general manner , among very low-income families , less than a quarter of a minimum salary per capita .
Happily , in not a single region or income band were situations found in which the chronic deficiency of energy would represent an unquestionable problem of public health .
A comparison of the 2003 inquiry with previous IBGE inquiries carried out in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s indicates a tendency of a drop in chronic energy deficiency and allows for the projection of a future close to the virtual elimination of the problem throughout all of the national territory .
Although the problem still exists in the semi-arid Northeast and among the poorest families , the Brazilian situation today has nothing to do with that found , for example , in Haiti , Ethiopia or India , where 20 % , 30 % and up to 50 % of adult individuals show clear signs of chronic energy deficiency .
-- Chronic energy deficiency is the modality of nutritional disturbance that gets closest to what the majority of people call hunger , with the advantage that we have objective indicators for its diagnosis within a population .
Sometimes one uses the term hunger as synonymous with poverty , of the non-access of people to the basic necessities .
Rather than helping , I believe that this free use of the word hunger confuses things and equates the problem to those who don 't have enough to eat , which , happily , are few and far between in the Brazil of today , and those who do not have adequate housing , sanitation , health assistance and quality of education .
Unfortunately , there are still lots of these people around .
And what is the specter of obesity in Brazil ?
-- Among men the trajectory of obesity is explosive throughout the country , with increases of 50 % every fifteen years .
Among women , the greatest increase occurred in the 70s and 80s , observed a certain stability in the 1990s , except in the northeast region and among low income families , in which female obesity continued to rise .
No matter what , in both sexes , four out of every ten adults in the country suffer from being overweight .
Obesity is already the second highest factor that kills and causes illnesses in Brazil .
These factors are consistent with the highlighted role of obesity towards hypertension and high cholesterol in the profile of illnesses and mortality in the country .
The IBGE study in which you yourself participated , which showed that obesity in Brazil is a much more serious public health hazard than that of hunger , was criticized by the President of the Republic .
What is your evaluation of the incident ?
-- Many voices were raised for and against this survey .
In all of my experience as a researcher , I can 't remember another survey having caused such major repercussions .
One part of the polemic situation I put down to the fact that many declarations and opinions about the survey were made by people who apparently had not consulted the publication , but in truth they reacted to the declarations and opinions of others who as well had not read the publication .
The other part of the confusion I attribute to the fact that the results revealed by the survey run contrary to a superficial vision , shall we say , of the true sanitary condition of the country .
According to this vision , the greatest health problems of the Brazilian population originate from illnesses associated with shortage , with absolute poverty , whilst the problems relative to excess consumption , such as obesity , belong exclusively to the better off social classes .
Anyhow , I believe that the IBGE survey fed , in a healthy manner , the debate surrounding Brazilian reality .
The reaction didn 't come from public opinion .
It came from the government that has as its banner the fight against hunger ...
-- The government 's reaction wasn 't homogenous .
There were , yes , comments that tried to discredit the IBGE survey or at least the obvious implications that it brought with it , but there were also thoughtful and imbued reactions of a constructive nature .
One needs to consider that the current government was elected having ' combating hunger and poverty ' as one of its largest if not the largest campaign slogan and also one has to take into account that the leading political party in the government has a long and recognized tradition in the fight involving social issues .
All of this produces the idea of a certain infallibility of this government in everything that is referred to as the ' social area ' .
It 's only that social policies are not made just by good intentions , there needs to be correct , unbiased diagnoses and analyses of the problems one intends to correct .
What 's your evaluation concerning the Zero Hunger Program ?
-- At the beginning , centered on the food donation campaigns , on a parade of celebrities and on ideas that difficult to label , such as the demand for invoices as evidence of spending on food by the benefited families , it was in fact very weak .
But the direction that the program took afterwards , emphasizing the transfer of income to families below the poverty line and giving incentive to the attendance of children at school and accompanying health through basic health clinics , was without doubt positive .
Clearly these actions are directed basically to combat poverty and not hunger .
But is poverty in the country sufficiently important for us to tolerate semantic impropriety ?
Does combating hunger not include the food distribution ?
-- As I have just mentioned , there are still regions with signs of chronic energy deficiency , mainly in the semi-arid region of the northeast .
There the supply of food is unstable due to the question of drought and of an archaic economic structure , very much different from the rest of the country .
There is as well the difficult and complex situation of the indigenous communities of the country .
Eventually , in situations of cyclic emergency , you really have to think about assistance , in distributing food quickly and efficiently .
The country will need to have these regional monitoring systems operating on the availability and consumption of food -- which we don 't yet have -- since hunger , when it occurs , is devastating and cannot wait .
But it 's clear that the definite solution for these regions is not to distribute food .
It 's to remove the causes that determine the problem , basically through instruments of local development .
Government authorities refer to a supposed fat hunger , which contemplates an association between obesity and starvation .
Does this exist ?
In Brazil , at least for now , the typical food of the poorest sector of the population is rice , beans , a vegetable and a little meat .
The bean , for example , is an excellent food , relatively cheap , a source of proteins , micronutrients and fiber , and has nothing to do with obesity , on the contrary .
From the point of view of the risk of obesity , the poor in Brazil , in general , tend to feed themselves better than the rich , since they consume less fats and less processed foods , which habitually have a high energetic density .
However , this picture is different in the developed countries , where intense industrialization of food production cheapened the cost of feeding and turned processed foods more accessible than natural foods .
We must be attentive , since this same situation could well occur in the future here in Brazil .
Why then the overreaction towards the hunger problem ?
-- I believe that the political scientist could better reply to this question , but I 'll risk it and say that the dramatization of hunger and the fact that it mobilizes society more than poverty are elements that merit consideration .
Are there social policies that could be sacrificed through the super evaluation of the hunger problem ?
-- Recently expressive resources were allocated in the Ministry of Health 's budget for the government 's program of income transfer .
The argument used was that , through combating poverty , we 're combating hunger and thus we 're improving peoples ' health .
But the Brazilian reality doesn 't correspond to this simplistic rational and , in fact , it 's highly probable that direct investments into the basic health network and in environmental sanitation would offer returns to the population 's health that are much greater than those associated with the transfer of income .
What 's the risk of looking only at hunger in a country in which obesity is advancing ?
-- When you create a program of income transfer , or when the economy grows , people expand their capacity of consumption .
What are they going to consume more ?
Studies have carried out concerning the relationship between income and food consumption indicate that it is highly probable that families of very low income will buy more food and that they will improve the nutritional quality of their food , diversify their diet and above all increase the meager consumption of products of animal origin , such as meat and milk products .
These changes could improve the nutritional conditions and health of these people , in particular their young aged children .
But the same thing can 't be said for families with incomes even below the point that were part of the clientele of the programs of income transfer , but not so low .
Why not ?
-- Among these families the increase in consumption of products of animal origin could easily lead to an excess of the consumption of fats , in particular of fats that are prejudicial to health , the saturated fats .
Also it 's highly probable that the consumption of processed foods will increase among these families that in general are of high calorific value , rich in fat , salt and poor in fiber and micronutrients .
As well it 's probable that an increase in the consumption of alcoholic drinks and the quantity of cigarettes consumed by smokers will be observed .
The habit of smoking in the country is concentrating itself more and more in the poorest segments of the population .
In summation , there 's no security that the final effect of increasing the purchasing power of relative segments of the Brazilian population will result in an improvement in their nutritional and health conditions .
Clearly an increase in the purchasing power of the population of low income could well produce more positive results for their conditions of nutrition and health , but we need to count upon more actions in the area on information and nutritional education of the population and also with fiscal and regulatory measures that make health foods such as fruit and horticultural products , for example , more accessible and lower the attraction of the less healthy foodstuffs .
What type of public policy would have the power to combat the problem of obesity ?
-- In the first instance we need to recognize that the control of the advance of obesity is extremely complex and needs actions that run from agricultural modifications , which will make possible a greater offer of healthy foods , to changes in urban planning capable of stimulating the regular practice of physical activities in towns and cities .
Fiscal measures that would make healthy foods more accessible and less accessible to non-healthy foods are indispensable , as well as regulatory measures that discipline the limits for marketing foods , completely prohibiting marketing directed towards children .
A permanent and systematic effort to educate and to awaken the conscience of people about the importance of healthy foods and of the fight against an inactive lifestyle are obviously essential .
In short , one can control obesity by supporting , protecting and promoting practices of healthy living .
Which countries have managed to solve this equation ?
-- There are very successful examples in developed countries that have managed to invert the growth of obesity or even to prevent it coming about as a public health problem .
In the first case we have the example of Finland and in the second case the examples of Japan and South Korea .
The parallel with the reduction in smoking conquered in the face of courageous public policies by various countries , including Brazil , is inevitable .
It 's alleged very often that the economic power of the food industry is very great , but isn 't that of the tobacco industry just the same ?
Anyhow , starting from last year we have an important ally in the fight to control obesity and other chronic illnesses associated with non-healthy foods and an inactive lifestyle .
This is the World Health Organization 's program named Global Strategy on Diet , Physical Activity and Health , which was discussed over various years by the scientific community and national governments , and finally approved by the World Health Assembly in May of 2004 .
The major advance within this strategy , which was strongly fought against by the United States and by other sectors opposing it from within the food industry , in particular sugar producers , is in admitting that information about more healthy choices concerning foods must be accompanied by government actions about the environment that makes these choices possible and easier , including fiscal and regulatory measures , which may not be appreciated by the economic sectors that profit from the consumption of non-healthy foods .
The IBGE research showed another reality : obesity advances , but there are sections of the population , such as middle class women , who are less fat than they were during the 1980s , thus showing a rare example of an inversion of this tendency .
To what do you attribute this ?
-- Brazil is a country that is incredibly permeable to changes .
At the same time that we were incorporating determined inadequate habits , non-healthy lifestyles , people were also taking in positive messages .
This appears to have occurred with Brazilian women who have an educational background of high school or above .
The 2003 survey provided evidence that throughout the country , with the exception of the northeast region , obesity among middle class women had stopped rising and had even begun to decline .
The available data didn 't make it possible to know the reasons for this tendency , which as yet hasn 't been described in any other developing country .
Anyhow t , in the male Brazilian population there 's no signal of the damping down of the growth of obesity within any of the social classes .
It 's said that the " Girl from Ipanema " is getting fat , as was suggested in the polemic article in the newspaper , The New York Times .
Perhaps it was the Girl from Bangu ( lower income neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro ) , but certainly not the one from Ipanema .
If hunger suffered a drastic reduction in Brazil during the decade of 1970 , infant malnutrition was only diminished more recently , in the decades of the 80s and 90s .
Why ?
-- Malnutrition of the adult is in a general manner a problem of shortage , of the absolute lack of food .
You only have hunger when misery is extreme .
If the adult has food , even living in an unfavorable habitat , it will be difficult for him to show clinical signs of malnutrition .
The increase in family income brought about by the growth in the Brazilian economy during the decade of the 1970s was decisive in reducing the proportion of the adult population exposed to malnutrition .
However , infant malnutrition has other determining factors as well as family income .
In particular one can highlight the exposure of children to episodes of infectious illnesses that end up undermining the child 's nutritional state .
And the main factors for the prevention of these illnesses -- environment sanitation , basic health assistance and the educational level of the mothers -- have only recently reached the poorest strata of the Brazilian population .
Is the Brazilian leading an inactive lifestyle ?
-- In a survey that we made starting from another IBGE study carried out in the country during 1997 , we showed that only 3 % of adults follow the recommendations of doing physical exercise at least thirty minutes daily during the majority of the days of the week .
Although in other countries , above all the developed countries , there are more people exercising , one can 't say that the country is a champion in sedentariness because one part of the population has jobs that demand spending energy regularly and intensely .
Starting from a monitoring system via telephone interviews , which we 're testing at the moment in various capital cities of the country , we estimate that in the city of Sao Paulo the proportion of people completely sedentary , or that is to say who don 't do , with minimum regularity , any type of moderate or intensive physical exercise , goes beyond 50 % .
And , in the case of women , there 's an inverse relationship with their educational background , or that is to say , the lower their educational background , the more frequent their sedentariness .
This inverse relationship offers an interesting clue for understanding why the prevalence of obesity in poorer women supplants by two or three times the same prevalence in women who are better off .
The study on standards and reasons for physical activity in the population is one of the major priorities for research into public health in the country .
And what can be done ?
-- Well , the size and complexity of the nutritional problems in a society such as the Brazilian society are so large that at times it 's difficult to convince the formulators of public policies and those who take the decisions that it 's worthwhile investing in this area .
As I said before , consistent actions in the area of the promotion of healthy foods are essentially , along with those that combine information and motivation with changes in the environment that allow for the choice of healthy options .
At the end of 2004 we carried out a relatively simple experiment in a very poor community in the district of Grajaú , in the southern zone of the city of Sao Paulo .
Firstly we carried out a field study that documented the poorness of this community in relation to the commercialization of healthy foods .
The options for buying food that we found were practically restricted to small stores that sold processed food , such as rice , macaroni , tinned sardines and hot dogs .
Fresh products , such as fruit and vegetables , were rare and when they existed were of very poor quality and highly priced .
Next , we studied over a period of one month the standard of purchases and consumption of foods within a sample of families .
The first part of the intervention that we implemented in the community consisted in offering to half of the selected families , information about feeding , nutrition and health and cookery classes that taught the preparation of healthy meals making more use of fruit , vegetables and legumes .
In the second part of the intervention , extended to all of the families , we established a " portable store " that went around the streets of the community three times per week for four weeks selling fruit and fresh horticultural produce that were of good quality , having been purchases at the Ceagesp market .
The evaluation of the impact of the intervention , which is still ongoing , indicates an increase of around 20 % in the consumption of fruit and horticultural produce only with the educational activities and motivation and a 50 % increase with the families who received full intervention .
We 're carrying out this study with financing from the CNPq on research into food safety .
For example , in the case of deficiencies in the supply of healthy foods and in the degree of information given to the population , I believe that the solution isn 't so difficult and will depend , above all , on the clear-sightedness of municipal governments and of the allocation of public investments .
There 're other measures that can equally be taken that are going on in various Brazilian municipalities , such as the improvement in the nutritional quality of foods and the restriction of the sale of unhealthy foods in school canteens .
But there 're other measures of public policy , equally necessary , which have found greater resistance in society and over which we have made very little advance .
For example , measures that restrict the publicizing of non-healthy foods and totally prohibit propaganda on the television directed specifically at children , along the lines of that which has already been done in various other developed countries .
There 's a project that has been lying dormant for some time in the Federal Senate , sponsored by senator Tião Viana , from the PT party of Acre State , whose approval could be an important sign of the concern of Brazilian parliamentarians and of the government with the process of nutritional transition through which our country is passing .

A journey between pain , pleasure and ethics
Mariluce Moura -- Editorial Director
Little is known about neurocysticercosis in Brazil .
From the Public Health point of view , one is dealing with a serious illness , which , supposedly , affects around 140,000 people in the country at this moment and which could certainly be avoided through some simple prophylactic measures .
And , so much so that there is an epidemic in vast regions of Latin America , of Asia and Africa -- which suggests its association with under development and poverty -- , the disease is practically non-existent in developed countries .
Looking closer to home and singularly at an illness , a parasite in the central nervous system , shows a dramatic face in many cases , marked by crises of epilepsy , a series of sad neuropsychiatric sufferings and even death to a number between 15 % and 25 % of its victims .
The cover story of this edition , put together by special editor Fabrício Marques , presents a wide diagnosis of the illness in the country and even reveals a piece of good news in the pathway of its dark panorama : an inexpensive test , developed by a team of São Paulo researchers , capable of detecting vestiges of the parasite 's DNA that brings about neurocysticercosis in the patient 's cerebrospinal fluid .
Because of this , diagnostic images are no longer the only alternative for deciding if someone is or is not a neurocysticercosis victim and adequate treatment can be started .
It 's just as well that scientific and technological research has a plasticity that is almost infinite , which in a certain manner allows us , on accompanying it , to run in parallel with practically all of the wide range of feelings and human emotions .
Thus , the article that disputed with neurocysticercosis the cover story for this edition , a long way from being associated with pain and sadness , brings to us a scent of glamour and sensuality , a delightful joyful fragrance , I would say .
This is an innovative process for the extraction of rosewood essential oil starting from its leaves , and no longer from the trunk of this tree that is native to the Amazon and is under threat of extinction , and guarantees , apart from its preservation , the continued production of Chanel Nº 5 , the perfume that Marilyn Monroe helped to transform into one of the greatest icons of the French cosmetics industry .
Who gives us this report is our assistant technology editor , Dinorah Ereno , starting on page 64 .
The concern with the preservation of native species in the Amazon , indeed , receives considerable support in the article that begins on page 68 , in which our special editor Marcos Pivetta relates how simulations made by computer indicate that the commercial extraction of certain majestic trees from the Amazon may not be a sustainable activity over a long period of time .
According to data produced virtually , two species of tree that have been tested , the tatajuba and the maçaranduba , would take more than a century to grow and restock the quantity of wood cut down .
While technology launches projections for the future , which recommend caution when managing the country 's natural resources , some glimpses back into the past brought about by research in the humanities field could reveal that not always were things as dramatic as we had thought in the processes of the formation of the Brazilian nation .
For example , the Christian missionary intervention brought the indigenous populations together , instead of only a cultural shock between winners and losers , with the destruction of the culture of the later , can perhaps be understood in a more subtle and complex manner as the establishing of relations between cultures where the cultural forms apparently condemned to disappear are recreated and reinvented so as to produce new significance .
This is the article from our humanities editor , Carlos Haag , starting on page 82 , taking as the article 's objective wide research into the missionaries of the Brazilian Amazon .
Curiously enough , this anthropological research has turned itself at this moment into amazing reality , just when the late Pope , a clear missionary who ritually shelter the differences during his incursions throughout the world , has left the scene , and the throne of Saint Peter has been assumed by another who , though conceding the importance of missionary work , submits the questions of doctrine and Christian faith as the major universal ethical question .
Good reading !

A long journey
Some one hundred and thirty years ago the trajectory of the first Brazilian women doctors began
Neldson Marcolin
The Medical School Faculty of the University of Sao Paulo ( FMUSP ) , the most famous and productive center of healthcare , teaching and medical research in Brazil , employed its first female full professor at the end of the 20th century , in the year 1996 , the pathologist and professor Maria Irma Seixas Duarte .
Each conquest demanded a huge effort , and as well , determination and courage to lead them to victory .
This was the case in 1875 with the Rio de Janeiro-born Maria Augusta Generoso Estrela , who at fifteen left for the United States to study medicine .
Four years later , Josefa Águeda Felisbela Mercedes de Oliveira from the state of Pernambuco took the same journey , at the same age as Maria Augusta .
The former caught sight of her future on reading about the graduation of a North American woman doctor .
Maria Augusta won out against the resistance of her father who sent her to New York where , at the end of 1876 , she managed to be accepted into the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women , a medical school aimed at women that was founded in 1863 .
Right from the start , these initial footsteps were followed by the Brazilian press that published period reports on her academic and personal life abroad .
Her prestige was such that the emperor Don Pedro II set aside a scholarship for her when her family 's ran out of money .
It was at the Medical College that Maria Augusta met Josefa , who had also managed to win over her father .
Josefa and Maria Augusta developed a great friendship and together published the literary journal A Mulher [ The Woman ] , produced in New York and distributed in the Brazilian capital cities .
Both graduated in 1881 .
Josefa returned to Recife and little is known of her path afterwards .
Maria Augusta remained a further year abroad and afterwards returned to Rio de Janeiro where she married and practiced for many years .
The unprecedented case of their struggle to study and their constant presence in the media helped in their being accepted , authorized by a teaching reform of women in higher education that began in 1879 , just months after Josefa had gone to New York .
With the new legislation , Rita Lobato Velho Lopes , born in the state of Rio Grande do Sul , in the town of Sao Pedro do Rio Grande , managed to enroll in the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro during 1884 , but then transferred to the Medical School of Bahia , from where she graduated as the first Brazilian woman doctor educated in the country .
In Sao Paulo , the Medical and Surgical Faculty , currently the FMUSP , had their first crop in 1913 , two women : Odette Nóra de Azevedo Antunes and Délia Ferraz Fávero .
Women 's conquests in medicine continued throughout the 20th century .
In 1998 , Angelita Gama became a full professor of surgery at the Gastroenterology Department of FMUSP .
As well as overcoming two obstacles -- one academic and the other in specializing -- , she broke yet another taboo in relation to surgery , traditionally considered to be a masculine activity .
The third edition of FAPESP 's Indicators registers an increase in public spending on S & T between 1998 and 2002
Claudia Izique
On the 10th of May , FAPESP launched the third issue of Science , Technology and Innovation Indicators in Sao Paulo -- 2004 , a detailed X-ray of the advance of research and development ( R & D ) in the State of Sao Paulo between 1998 and 2002 .
In the same manner as the two previous issues ( 1995 and 2001 ) , the publication aims to assist the formulation of scientific and technological policy in Sao Paulo and the country .
The third issue , put together by nearly forty specialists , is organized around three large blocks of indicators -- inputs , results and economic and social impacts .
Throughout its twelve thematic chapters , the science and technology developed in São Paulo are interpreted , taking as a backstage , the national and international contexts .
The volume even integrates the statistical series from which the indicators were built and the description of the methodologies adopted in the collecting and treatment of the data presented , as Regina Gusmão , the third edition 's coordinator , underlines .
Spending on R & D -- In what is referred to as spending on R & D , the Indicators adopted a new methodology for the identification and collection of data distinct from that used during the other editions ( 1995 and 2001 ) .
In order to delimit the field of activities in the State of Sao Paulo , the authors emphasized the comparability of group numbers , based on the recommendations of the Frascati Manual , made out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , and already adopted by the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2001 .
Public spending on R & D was calculated based on on budgetary execution .
Based on this criterion , the authors registered an increase in expenditure in the state of Sao Paulo between 1998 and 2002 .
These expenditures kept themselves above R $ 2.3 billion during this period .
The expenditures of the state government -- which corresponds to almost 60 % of the total -- proved to be more dynamic than those of the federal government in Sao Paulo .
In Sao Paulo , this increase was principally determined as spending through the development institutions .
FAPESP maintained a leading position , being responsible for more than 56 % of the total of the resources destined towards development in the state .
The annual spending on post graduation also contributed to the increase in public expenditure .
This totaled R $ 863 million , on average , 84 % having been spent on the three state universities , led by the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) , followed by the São Paulo State University ( Unesp ) and the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) .
In the calculation of private investments , the third edition of Indicators incorporated the data base from the Industrial Research and Technological Innovation 2000 ( Pintec ) , of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE ) , carried out over 10,000 companies , as well as the special tabulation of Pintec 2003 that the institute should release during the second quarter of this year , according to Sandra Hollanda , the coordinator of the chapter concerning expenditure on R & D .
In the other editions of the Indicators this calculation was done using information collected by the National Research , Development and Engineering Association of Innovative Companies ( Anpei in the Portuguese acronym ) with coverage of between four to six hundred companies .
For this new criterion , the participation of companies in the total spending on R & D in Sao Paulo during 2000 was 54 % .
At the national level , during the same period , public investment was still the largest , which , in the total of spending on R & D , represented 58 % as opposed to 48 % from the private sector .
These results , nevertheless , must be put into perspective , as Sandra herself observes , since the Pintec is carried out by probability sampling and has a margin of error of 30 % .
The new methodology still has to be perfected .
Patent registrations -- In spite of the positive signs in the chapter on R & D spending , the Indicators show an accentuated distancing of the Brazilian standard of investment in science and technology compared to the industrialized countries , which maintains open the challenge to search for solutions to boost technological advance .
The evidence of this statement lies in the chapter dedicated to the intellectual property indicators .
In the number of patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( Uspto ) Brazilians showed modest , even though persistent , growth between 1999 and 2001 , until closing the period with 0.07 % of the total registered .
Sao Paulo 's contribution represented half of the national effort during this period , similar to its participation in the patent requests registered through the National Institute for Industrial Property ( INPI in the Portuguese acronym ) between 1990 and 2001 .
Indeed , the data reveals that of the twenty leading Brazilian entities in filing patents between 1990 and 2001 , seven were located in Sao Paulo , among them two universities and three research institutes .
Further , the authors highlight the highly elevated weight , about 70 % , of the patent requests in the INPI system filed by individuals in relation to company requests , both in the case of Sao Paulo and in Brazil .
This picture , in accordance with specialized literature , is associated to backwardness and underdevelopment , the research authors point out .
Inversely , projected onto an international plane , the data reveals the preponderance of patents conceded to companies , the vast majority represented by transnational companies .
The chapter concerning the technological balance of payments makes clear the price that the country is paying for technological backwardness .
Between 1998 and 2002 , the participation of high technology products in exports of the State of Sao Paulo accounted for between 25 % to 30 % , whilst the situation of Brazil as a whole was between 15 % and 20 % .
Technologically advanced countries have around half of their exports concentrated in high technology goods and they represent average export values greater than those imported .
This relationship is inverted in countries where the technological sophistication of their industry is low .
This is the case of Brazil and Sao Paulo , classified amongst the regions and countries of medium degree of technological development that is characterized by deficits in the trade balance of high technology goods and in the balance of payments of technological services .
This provides evidence of the high dependency of Brazil and the State of Sao Paulo in relation to foreign technology .
In the case of Sao Paulo , this problem appears in the most visible manner : in what is referred to as external sales , the state fits itself into the intermediary level of international integration , similar to that of Italy .
But , on the purchasing side , it has a performance similar to that of the most advanced countries , such as Germany of France .
The indicators relative to human resources available in science and technology are also not cheering .
In 2001 , the number of people occupied in science and technology in the country were some 11.2 million and in Sao Paulo , 3.6 million , a level comparable to those of France and the United Kingdom , according to the parameters of the OECD .
Furthermore , when related to the active economic population ( EAP ) , the results are unfavorable : the people working throughout the country represent 12 % of the EAP and in Sao Paulo it is 17 % , as opposed to the level of 40 % observed in the above mentioned countries .
Tertiary education -- The Indicators point to an acceleration of the growth rhythm in enrollments of college education in the country in relation to the period 1995 -- 1998 , with the admission of more than 1.3 million students into the system .
This growing demand is a result of the duplication of the number of high school graduates , together with the progressive rise in the number of universities in the interior of States and their diversification throughout the country .
Between 1998 and 2002 , Sao Paulo registered a 46 % increase in the number of student matriculations , 89 % in pre-university courses and 40 % in total at teaching institutions .
In Brazil as a whole , this growth in the number of graduates was even more accentuated , with a growth of 64 % in matriculations , 107 % in the number of courses and 68 % in the teaching institutions .
The private network was the main vehicle responsible for the expansion in graduation , with an increase of 50 % in the number of matriculations , in the case of Sao Paulo , and of 84 % in the remainder of the country .
Indeed , the authors identified a " flash flood " in the expansion of the private sector , when verifying a significant drop in the relationship in the number of applicants per opening in the selection processes .
Enrollment in post-graduate courses , contrary to the undergraduate courses , have concentrated themselves in the public network , which between 1998 and 2002 maintained the pace of growth already registered during the second edition of Indicators .
The number of enrollments in the State of São Paulo during 2002 had still represented 37 % of the vacancies in all of the country .
The vast majority of the courses were offered by the three major state universities .
The private network courses had not reached 17 % of the total vacancies for master 's degrees and 7 % for doctorate degrees .
Indeed , post-graduation continues in clear expansion in the rest of the country , though at a slower rate of pace , without compromising the standard of academic excellence and of the excellence of the courses being offered .

The light partners
The KyaTera Project integrates dozens of laboratories by way of optical fibers
A project that is going to interlink dozens of laboratories in the State of Sao Paulo by way of optical fibers began operations on the 14th of April .
Financed through FAPESP , the KyaTera Project ( Optical Research Platform for the Development of an Advanced Internet ) brings together unprecedented tools , capable of displacing the institutional and geographic frontiers that separate researchers .
By way of its platform , an individual installed in a laboratory at the University of Sao Paulo ( USP ) , for example , could control , by way of programs developed for the network , instruments in a laboratory of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) .
It will not just be a platform but also a stage for research concerning applications for the advanced internet .
The first trials were carried out at a speed of 320 gigabits per second , but its capacity has no limits , hence the illusion to the terabit , which corresponds to 1,000 gigabits .
Kya means a fish net in the tupi-guarani ( native language of Brazil ) .
Tera , in Greek , stands for the value of 1 trillion .
" More than just researching applications via the internet , the platform will allow for researching the network itself , as to the quantity of terabits that can be transmitted in a fiber , " explains the project 's coordinator , Hugo Fragnito , a professor at the Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute of Unicamp .
Selected projects -- During the first phase , institutions from the city of São Paulo , such as USP , the Heart Institute and Mackenzie University , were interlinked with institutions in Campinas , namely Unicamp , the Catholic Pontifical University and the CPqD ( Research and Development center in Telecommunications ) .
Shortly there will be a connection with Sao Carlos ( USP and the Federal University ) and later on with laboratories in the cities of Rio Claro , Santos , Bauru , Ribeirão Preto and Sao José dos Campos .
FAPESP has already selected projects for the KyaTera that involve six hundred ( 600 ) professors and students linked to groups of excellence in areas such as physics , mechanical and electrical engineering , computing , mechatronics , robotics , biology and medicine .
The KyaTera Project is integrated into FAPESP 's Tidia Program ( Information Technology in the Development of an Advanced Internet ) .
The operational base will be used for other projects linked to the Tidia Program , such as the development of tools for teaching and learning via the internet .
A ceremony carried out on the 14th of April at Unicamp marked the start of the KyaTera Project operations .
José Fernando Perez , in one of his final commitments as FAPESP 's scientific director acquainted those present with the KyaTera Project within the challenges that the Foundation and Brazilian research are confronting .
Citing the book O Sol , o genoma e a internet [ The Sun , the Genome and the Internet ] , in which the author , Freeman Dyson , points to three fundamental questions for the future of humanity , Dr. Perez stated : " As to the sun , our tropical country has it in abundance .
In relation to the genome , Brazil entered onto the map of the countries that have carried out relevant research .
Concerning the internet , the KyaTera Project also shows that we 're dedicating our best efforts , " said Dr. Perez , who was congratulated by his successor , Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz , who was also present at the ceremony as one of his final commitments in the role of Unicamp rector .
The multiplication of ideas
Network wants to spread useful technologies to poor communities
Claudia Izique
A simple and innovative solution guarantees the survival of hundreds of families in the Brazilian semi-arid regions .
In the surrounding of a water tank in a circular format , they plant vegetables , legumes and fruit that are irrigated by hoses or PET bottles .
In the tanks themselves they breed fish and birds that feed themselves on nocturnal insects - strategically attracted by a lamp - and they enrich the water with the necessary nutrients for the development of these crops .
Called as Mandalla , this irrigation system - conceived by Willy Pessoa Rodrigues , a business administrator linked to a non-governmental organization in the region - is boosting the supply of food and the income of poor families .
Examples such as this have stimulated thirteen entities of the public sector , non-governmental organizations and universities - represented by the National Forum of Extension Pro-Rectors - to create the Social Technology Network in order to spread the use of innovative solutions such as Mandalla to other regions .
The project began to be drawn up during 2004 , with the enthusiastic support of the Secretary of Government Communications and Strategic Management of the President of the Republic ( Secom ) .
" Social technologies need to break with isolationism and make themselves viable as national projects on a large scale .
In order to invert this picture , we need articulation and cohesion between all the organizing agents , " Luiz Gushiken , the minister of Secom argued at that time .
After a long period of gestation , the network was activated on the 14th of April with the objective of spreading very successful experiences , stimulating the development of new social technologies and guaranteeing the scale of diverse applications , duly adapted to regional reality .
Social technologies , in the government 's conception , are re-applicable techniques or methodologies , developed in an interaction with the community .
They gained projection in 2001 when the Banco do Brasil Foundation created an award involving the selection of successful experiences and sponsored their implementation in other regions of the country .
The Mandalla system , for example , one of the ones awarded a prize in 2003 , will be replicated 1,100 times this year , in a foundation partnership between the Ministry of National Integration and the Brazilian Service for the Support of Micro and Small Businesses ( Sebrae ) .
Data bank - The network can be accessed through the website www.redetecnologiasocial.net , developed by the Brazilian Association of Technological Research Institutions ( Abipti ) , which also gives access to a data bank with experiences in the areas of employment and income , water access , sanitation , alternative energy sources , health , education and housing among others .
On the day of the inauguration , one hundred and thirty ( 130 ) public and private entities , along with non-governmental organizations had already joined the project .
The network has as its financial backers the ministries of Science and Technology and of Social Development and Fighting Hunger , the Financier of Studies and Projects ( Finep ) , the Banco do Brasil Foundation , Petrobras , the Federal Caixa Econômica and Sebrae .
" Social technologies are generating employment and income in the poorest regions of the country , " explains the minister of Science and Technology , Eduardo Campos .
Each one of the above listed sponsors will annually contribute , at the minimum , R $ 2 million for the re-application of technologies previously selected .
As well as this , there is a predisposition between the partners to integrate the network 's objectives into other social programs already ongoing .
Petrobras , for example , as well as the R $ 5 million that the company will destine towards the network , will open up to the community wells which no oil was found but will give access to the water table , and could certainly be used for irrigation projects or even for the replication of Mandallas .
" Many of these wells , which had been closed up , will be reopened , " says Luiz Fernando Nery , the company 's communications manager .
Learning with the people - The government 's expectation is to incorporate social technologies into public policies .
The Secretariat of Social Inclusion of the Ministry of Science and Technology , foe example , has published tenders for the funding of social technology projects to the value of R $ 34.5 million , with the objective of stimulating the development of new technologies for the north and semi-arid regions .
As well as the research institutes , entities that provide third party services can also make proposals .
" We want to support the scientists that work with cutting edge technology and , at the same time , remember the forgotten part of Brazil , " says minister Eduardo Campos .
" The scientists and researchers are going to learn with the people . "
Finep can also already count upon a specific area for the support of social technologies , according to Eliane Bahruth , the director of Finep 's Innovation for Economic and Social Development .
In partnership with the Federal Caixa Econômica and the Ministry of Social Development and Combating Hunger , the entity announced a public calling for the financing of the incubation of joint enterprises .
The network can count upon an executive secretary and will have its activities closely accompanies by a management committee , formed from representatives of the thirteen entities , which will meet every fifteen days .
Annually a national forum will evaluate the established goals .
Award for good projects
The Banco do Brasil Foundation has opened up subscriptions for the third edition of the Banco do Brasil Foundation award for Social Technology .
The eight best technology projects that have been successfully implemented into poor communities , will receive awards totaling R $ 400,000.00 .
Qualified to participate in the competition are non-profit making entities such as universities , non-governmental organizations , cities and companies , among others .
Those interested can register their projects until the 30th of June through the website : www.fundacaobancodobrasil.org.br All of the inscribed projects that fit into the concept of social technology will receive a certificate and will go on to be integrated into the Social Technology Bank , accessible to public management , social enterprises and community leaderships .
" Currently we are re-applying a series of social technologies that were finalists and winners , " says Jacques Pena , the president of the Banco do Brasil Foundation .
Among these technologies president Pena cited the fourteen mini-factories involved with the cashew nut enterprise , in operation since 2003 with the support of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation ( Embrapa ) , Sebrae and Telemar .
The expectation is that the project will create some 5,800 jobs in the states of Ceará , Piauí , Rio Grande do Norte , Bahia and Maranhão by the year 2006 .
This year , the award will have two special categories - social technology directed towards the Management of Water Resources and the Rights of Children and Adolescents - as a result of a partnership signed with Petrobras .

Parasite Unveiled
Neurocysticercosis , an illness that can hide itself through disregard and difficulty of diagnosis , is beginning to show its true dimension
Fabrício Marques
Genetics is instigating a new form of diagnosing neurocysticercosis , the most important parasite illness that attacks the central nervous system .
The ailment characterizes itself through the installation in the brain of a larva acquired by the ingestion of food contaminated with eggs of the Taenia solium and is practically unheard of in developed countries .
But it emerges as a major public health problem in wide regions of Latin America , Asia and Africa , producing neuropsychiatric injuries and killing between 15 % to 20 % of its victims .
In Brazil it is endemic to various regions and it is presumed to attack 140,000 people .
The spectrum of the illness is not known for certain , because of diagnostic difficulties .
In general , neurocysticercosis is only researched in patients who have sought out neurology clinics with symptoms such as epilepsy crises and psychiatric disorders .
But recent studies indicate that the incidence of the illness is high even in states supposedly free of it .
There are tests capable of detecting the antibodies produced against the invader , but not one of them is specific to the point of attesting to or being exclusive to the illness .
The diagnosis is only conclusive with the help of nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) imaging or with a computerized tomography scan , which point out one or more cysts , at times many , that populate regions of the patient 's brain .
The new situation is that genetic research beckons a cheap test capable of detecting vestiges of DNA of the worm in samples of the cerebrospinal fluid , also known as a liquor , which surrounds and protects the brain .
A team led by the specialist in molecular genetic , Emmanuel Dias Neto , from the Neurosciences Laboratory of the Medical School of the University of Sao Paulo ( FMUSP ) , has demonstrated for the first time that the DNA of the invader is present in the liquor .
And they have developed a molecular detection examination for the presence of the parasite based on the multiplication of the DNA by way of the PCR method ( Polymerase Chain Reaction ) .
The test was created in partnership with researchers from the Neurology Department of the FMUSP , of the Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of USP and the Medical Faculty of USP in Ribeirao Preto , within a project financed by the National Counsel for Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) and by the Alzira Denise Hertzog Silva Benevolent Association ( Abadhs ) .
On evaluating some thirty patients with neurocysticercosis , the new method exhibited a sensitivity of 96.7 % in detecting the parasite - it gave a positive result in twenty nine ( 29 ) of the cases .
A control group of ten patients without the disease , attested to its efficiency .
The team is submitting their findings for publication in a scientific magazine and has gone in search of a patent .
" We already have a company interested , " says Emmanuel .
The research will be presented in the master 's degree thesis of Carolina Rodrigues Almeida , supervised by Dr. Emmanuel at the Psychiatry Department of FMUSP .
The coming of the test promises to expand the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis , offering precise and cheaper examinations than the diagnosis through neuroimaging .
The genetic hopes are reaching other sides of the illness .
Emmanuel 's team is still the leader in pioneering work in the identification of the functional genes of this cysticercosis , the larval form that causes neurocysticercosis .
2,880 ESTs have already been identified - fragments of active genes that are denominated as Expressed Sequence Tags , in accordance with a techniques conceived by the researcher Dr. Andrew Simpson and by Dr. Emmanuel himself , when they had worked at the Ludwig Cancer Research Institute .
The Brazilian methodology received the acronym Orestes ( Open Reading Expressed Sequence Tags ) .
This technique has already been used in the Cancer Genome Project and also during the study of the Schistosomiasis mansoni genome , which causes schistosomiasis .
" I was surprised when I discovered that there was no sequencing of the EST type of the parasite that causes neurocysticercosis , " says Emmanuel , who became interested in the question while working at the Psychiatry Department of the FMUSP .
" We 've already found a large quantity of new genes of the parasite , which include candidates for the development of therapies and tests , " adds Carolina Almeida .
The possibility of widening the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is essential for combating the malady .
" The illness is extremely serious and confronts many problems in the field of prevention , and begins with the fact that there is no obligation to notify cases , " says Vicente Amato Neto , a full professor at the Infectious and Parasite Illnesses Department of the FMUSP .
" It seems that very frequently neurological clinics deal with the main symptoms but it 's difficult to know the true occurrence in the population because there 's no search to detect it . "
Recent studies show that the spectrum is even greater than had been imagined .
An example is the situation in Piauí , a state that was not included on the map of incidents of the malady in Brazil .
In reality it seemed to be free of the ailment because nobody had taken the trouble to look for neurocysticercosis there .
Between 1999 and 2001 , A research team from three states , led by Alberto Novaes Ramos Junior , from the Community Health Department of the Federal University of Ceará , carried out a wide ranging investigation into parasite illnesses in João Costa , a poor municipality of some 3,000 inhabitants , living on the edge of the National Park named Capivara Sierra .
One hundred and sixty nine ( 169 ) people were identified with symptoms comparable to those of human neurocysticercosis , such as migraine headaches and epileptic crises .
Immunological examinations detected the antibodies that react against cysticercosis in twenty-seven of them .
The major lesson from the Piauí research is that the epidemiological reality of the illness in Brazil remains unknown as it has been only slightly investigated .
Santa Catarina State has also begun to unveil the real dimension of neurocysticercosis .
The analysis of 143,000 cCT scans out during the 1990s in different regions has revealed an occurrence of 1.2 % of neurocysticercosis .
In a more specific universe , of the 1,849 patients attended to with neurological symptoms , the percentage of the positive exams reached the order of 30 % .
Two regions were pointed to in case rankings , the municipalities of Lages and Chapecó .
" They 're regions where pig farming is traditional .
But the cases usually involve people from the poor surrounding municipalities where the farming is carried out in a rudimentary fashion , " says Mario Steindel , a professor at the Microbiology and Parasitology Department of the Federal University of Santa Catarina ( UFSC ) .
The researcher Maria Márcia Imenes Ishida , also from UFSC , is studying the surroundings of the Lages municipality .
Four hundred ( 400 ) blood samples have already been collected that are being analyzed in the search for antibodies .
The objective is to carry out an epidemiological survey in the locality to determine the prevalence and to identify risk factors associated with the parasite , both in the rural and urban populations surrounding Lages .
Hermaphrodite - The ignorance concerning the ways of being contaminated conspire in favor of proliferation .
In general , neurocysticercosis is associated with pork meat and it is imagined that it is enough to avoid the consumption of recipes based on pork , as well as its derivatives , to remain clear of it .
That 's not quite the situation .
When an individual eats pork contaminated by cysticercosis , the parasite 's larvae , the risk of getting another illness , taeniasis , exists .
Once swallowed , the cysts encrusted in the pig 's muscles transform themselves , within the human intestine , into Taenia solium , the adult form of the parasite , known as taenia or tapeworm .
One is dealing with a worm with an elongated body in the form of a tape .
The taenia is hermaphroditic and manufactures thousands of eggs , which are liberated within the human feces .
Each day the undesirable intestine host evacuates between 50,000 and 60,000 microscopic eggs .
The cycle of the taeniasis closes when the pig swallows water or food that had contact with the contaminated feces of man .
In the pig 's organism , these eggs are converted into new larvae that are going to populate the pig 's meat and , finally , infect the person who eats it .
Taeniasis can cause retardation in the growth of children and brings about damage in adults , such as the loss of the capacity to work .
But there is a relatively simple treatment : the administration of specific vermifuges is capable of eliminating it from the organism .
Another worm , named Taenia saginata , a parasite in cattle , can also cause taeniasis in human beings .
But only the Taenia solium , the pork tapeworm , participates in the evolutionary cycle of neurocysticercosis .
Thus the illness is transmitted to everybody who eats that particular food .
And there is no point in immersing the salad in a solution to kill off germs , such as vinegar or hypochlorite .
Only the mechanical removal , with running water and the manual cleaning of each leaf , is capable of getting rid of the danger .
A classic case in medical literature was published in 1992 in the scientific magazine The New England Journal of Medicine , in which four orthodox Jews from the same New York family received the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis .
She was responsible for contaminating the family for whom she had been working .
In the pig , the cysts normally install themselves in the muscles and do not represent a danger to the animal 's life .
But the worm has as its preferred location inserting itself into the central nervous system , the final address of 90 % of the invaders .
After having arrived at the digestive organ , the eggs pass through the wall of the intestine and penetrate into the bloodstream .
When they migrate to the central nervous system , they first reach small blood veins between the nerve
Neurocysticercosis can present itself in two forms : the cystic form , known as Cysticercus cellulosae , and , in ringlets with numerous cysts , called Cysticercus racemosus .
The illness produces specific damages , depending on the location where it installs itself , the size attained by each lesion ( from 2 to 43 millimeters ) and by the immunological response of the human organism .
It is common that the growth of worms pressurizes regions of the brain and blocks the passage of the cerebrospinal liquor .
This liquid is continually produced and any problem that interferes with its absorption and replacement alters the intra-cranium pressure , with serious neurological consequences .
It can cause very serious lesions and even death .
According to a research survey into the illness in Brazil carried out by the medical doctor , Svetlana Agapejev , from the Neurology and Psychiatric Department of the Medical School of Botucatu ( Unesp ) , most victims in Brazil are men , aged between 31 and 50 years .
The most serious examples , nevertheless , are concentrated amongst women between 21 and 40 years , who live in urban areas , and generally suffer from intra-cranium hypertension .
The reason for the difference is unknown .
It is speculated that some hormonal factor exists and interferes with the evolution of the ailment .
The larvae survive in the human organism for a period of three to six years .
In the past it was relatively common to attempt to rid the illness surgically .
But , above all , recourse to surgery is to minimize the symptoms , such as draining in cases of hydrocephalus .
In the same manner , there are treatments administered according to the development of the illness , such as corticoids , in the case of meningitis , or anti-convulsions medicine , if epilepsy occurs , as well as anti-inflammatory and analgesic medicines .
Some cases are treated with two medications , albendazole and praziquantel , capable of killing cysticercosis installed in determined accessible locations of the central nervous system .
This therapy , however , is controversial .
It so happens that the cysticercosis , sooner or later , will truly die - without the power of leaving heirs - and its extermination produced by medication could well unchain a complicated inflammatory process .
" A study showed that patients treated with albendazole developed symptoms that were milder than with the patients who had not received the medicine , " sasy Osvaldo Takayanagui , a neurology professor at USP 's Medical Faculty in Ribeirao Preto .
During 1993 , the International Task Force for the Disease Eradication , linked to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , classified neurocysticercosis as a rare example of an ailment that could be eliminated from the planet , amongst some ninety three ( 93 ) infectious and parasitic ailments studied .
The illness has been eradicated in countries such as Japan , Canada and in the greater part of Western Europe .
Today in the United States less than one thousand cases are registered per year .
The problem re-appeared thanks to the influx of migratory workers from Latin America , where the illness has spread to some 350,000 cases in eighteen countries .
In Mexico , neurocysticercosis accounts for 10 % of the final diagnoses carried out in neurological hospitals .
It remains a serious public health problem in Africa , where there is a scarcity of epidemiological studies , and in Asia , above all in China and India , but also in Thailand , the Philippines and South Korea .
It is estimated that some 50 million people have been infected by the taeniasis / cysticercosis complex throughout the world .
50,000 of them die of it every year .
Preference - An efficient control program for the illness would include , in the first place , the monitoring of the quality of pork meat .
Today , the sanitary inspection carried out in Brazil looks for vestiges of the larvae in organs such as the heart , the tongue , the diaphragm and muscles , locations where cysticercosis prefers .
But the worm can also be found in other organs , hence the importance of always cooking pork meat well .
The ideal situation would be to submit the slaughtered pigs to immunological examinations , which are capable of finding vestiges of antibodies against the cysticercosis .
According to directives from the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) , as well as monitoring the meat , it is important to create a system of compulsory notification of cases of taeniasis , including those who visited the families of victims , in order to deter the contamination in the domestic environment .
It is also vital to inspect the quality of vegetables and to demand the presentation of a parasite examination of the feces of any professional who works with food during the renovation of their health permit as well as , more obviously , improved sanitary conditions for the population .
The PAHO has also suggested , as an extreme measure , administering vermifuges to all of the people within a community that has been badly hit by the illness .
Few Brazilian States , such as Parana , Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul , have some type of preventative program available .
The city of Ribeirao Preto , in the interior of the state of São Paulo , has one of the best thought out schemes to combat the illness in the country , brought about by the elevated incidence of the illness in that region over the last few decades .
As well as the compulsory notification of cases , even the quality of the vegetables sold at street markets and municipal markets were evaluated .
A high level of contamination by fecal coliforms was revealed , a sign of lack of hygiene , but not a single trace of Taenia solium eggs .
Since this program began , a rare epidemiological trustworthy statistic concerning the disease in Brazil has come out .
There are 74.1 cases of neurocysticercosis in the city of Ribeirao Preto for every 100,000 inhabitants .
" We can 't say if its a lot or it 's a little because of the lack of parameters from other locations with which we might compare , " says Osvaldo Takayanagui .
The illness , in spite of the program 's efficiency , shows have force .
Around 25 % of the victims showed live cysticercosis , in a clear signal that the illness was contracted in the very recent past .
Peptides - A still as yet distant promise is the development of a vaccine capable of blocking the taeniasis cycle and that of the neurocysticercosis in the hosts .
There are studies taking place in Mexico of a vaccine based on three synthesized peptides shared by Taenia solium and Taenia crassiceps , the parasite of foxes .
The major holdup , in this case , is economic : the cost of synthesizing these peptides is high .
In the past Chinese researchers concluded that the antigen cC1 , obtained from Taenia crassiceps , is a good candidate for the development of a vaccine against Taenia solium .
In 1999 , an Australian researcher managed to develop a vaccine with the combined use of three different antigens , which achieved a level of protection of 93 % of the part of the body that are deliberately infected .
Perhaps this vaccine will not be efficient in Brazil given the genetic variability of Taenia solium throughout the planet .
" We need to concentrate our efforts towards understanding other genes and proteins of the parasite in order to expand the potential for antigens that can be tested , " says Emmanuel Dias Neto .
Brazil , with the experience that it has been accumulating in genomic science , has an important contribution to make in this field .
Safety measures that doctors recommend
Eat pork meat and its derivatives that have been well cooked and that were acquired in an establishment subject to sanitary inspection .
Vegetables must be very well washed before consumption .
Drink only filtered or boiled water .
Wash your hands before meals , before preparing food and after using the bathroom .
Carry out periodic feces examination and look for treatment if necessary .
Provide an adequate exit for human feces , by way of septic tanks or a public sewage network .
